Some scholars add authors to their research papers or grant proposals even when those
individuals contribute nothing to the research effort. Some journal editors coerce authors to
add citations that are not pertinent to their work and some authors pad their reference lists
with superfluous citations. How prevalent are these types of manipulation, why do scholars
stoop to such practices, and who among us is most susceptible to such ethical lapses? This
study builds a framework around how intense competition for limited journal space and
research funding can encourage manipulation and then uses that framework to develop
hypotheses about who manipulates and why they do so. We test those hypotheses using
data from over 12,000 responses to a series of surveys sent to more than 110,000 scholars
from eighteen different disciplines spread across science, engineering, social science, business,
and health care. We find widespread misattribution in publications and in research
proposals with significant variation by academic rank, discipline, sex, publication history, coauthors,
etc. Even though the majority of scholars disapprove of such tactics, many feel
pressured to make such additions while others suggest that it is just the way the game is
played. The findings suggest that certain changes in the review process might help to stem
this ethical decline, but progress could be slow.
