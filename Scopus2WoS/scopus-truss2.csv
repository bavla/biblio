In this paper, we use the k-truss model to measure the stability of a social network. To identify critical connections, we propose a novel problem, named k-truss minimization. Given a social network G and a budget b, it aims to find b edges for deletion which can lead to the maximum number of edge breaks in the k-truss of G. We show that the problem is NP-hard. To accelerate the computation, novel pruning rules are developed to reduce the candidate size. In addition, we propose an upper bound based strategy to further reduce the searching space. Comprehensive experiments are conducted over real social networks to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed techniques. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

In many applications, real-world structures with high connectivity and robustness are preferable. For enhancing the connectivity and robustness of graphs, two operations, adding edges and anchoring nodes, have been extensively studied. However, merging nodes, which is a realistic operation in many scenarios (e.g., bus station reorganization, multiple team formation), has been overlooked. In this work, we study the problem of improving graph cohesiveness by merging nodes. First, we formulate the problem mathematically using the size of the k-truss, for a given k, as the objective. Then, we prove the NP-hardness and non-modularity of the problem. After that, we develop BATMAN, a fast and effective algorithm for choosing sets of nodes to be merged, based on our theoretical findings and empirical observations. Lastly, we demonstrate the superiority of BATMAN over several baselines, in terms of speed and effectiveness, through extensive experiments on fourteen real-world graphs.  © 2023 ACM.","combinatorial optimization;

We thus need to represent the node and connections accurate and effectively, and representation learning could be a promising method. In this paper, we investigate a novel social similarity-based method for learning network representations. We first introduce neighborhood structural features for representing node identities based on higher-order structural parameters. Then the node representations are learned by a random walk approach that based on the structural features. Our proposed truss2vec is able to maintain both structural similarity of nodes and domain similarity. Extensive experiments have shown that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.

Modeling and analyzing uncertain graphs has attracted a great deal of attention. Among the various graph analytic tasks studied, the extraction of dense substructures, such as cores or trusses, has a central role. In this paper, we study the problem of (k,  3)-truss indexing and querying over an uncertain graph . A (k,  3)-truss is the largest subgraph of , such that the probability of each edge being contained in at least k - 2 triangles is no less than  3. Our first proposal, CPT-index, keeps all the (k,  3)-trusses: retrieval for any given k and ?can be executed in an optimal linear time w.r.t. the graph size of the queried (k,  3)-truss. We develop a bottom-up CPT-indexconstruction scheme and an improved algorithm for fast CPT-indexconstruction using top-down graph partitions. For trading off between (k,  3)-truss offline indexing and online querying, we further develop an approximate indexing approach (  Âµ,  ""r)-APXequipped with two parameters,   Âµ and  ""r, that govern tolerated errors. Extensive experiments using large-scale uncertain graphs with 261 million edges validate the efficiency of our proposed indexing and querying algorithms against state-of-the-art methods.

In order to identify communities, several definitions were proposed that can characterize the density of connections among vertices in the networks. Dense triangle cores, also known as k-trusses, are subgraphs in which every edge participates at least k- 2 triangles (a clique of size 3), exhibiting a high degree of cohesiveness among vertices. There are a number of research works that propose k-truss decomposition algorithms. However, existing in-memory algorithms for computing k-truss are inefficient for handling today’s massive networks. In this paper, we propose an efficient, yet scalable algorithm for finding k-trusses in a large-scale network. To this end, we propose a new structure, called triangle graph to speed up the process of finding the k-trusses and prove the correctness and efficiency of our method. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through extensive experiments using real-world networks. The results of comprehensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods by several orders of magnitudes in running time. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Community detection;

Existing techniques for quantifying network similarity range from network-centric methods that consider global network topology to node-centric methods that consider local node-level sub-structures. In this paper, we address the research gap between computationally expensive network-centric approaches and myopic node-centric network comparison methods by introducing a novel approach to quantify network similarity based on hierarchical graph decomposition. The approach adequately captures both global and local topology and is motivated by the observation that networks from diverse domains such as physical, chemical, biological and social systems exhibit an inherent structural hierarchy that emerges from local dyadic and triadic interactions. The proposed algorithm, Network Similarity via graph Decomposition (NSD), extracts network signatures from hierarchical decomposition of networks and uses Canberra distance to quantify the similarity between signatures. We use two well-known graph decomposition methods to expose network hierarchy resulting in two variations of NSD. We find that our approach groups similar networks better than competing algorithms. Experimentation using 40 real-world networks, 15 massive networks, and 30 large synthetic networks establishes that the proposed methodology is effective, scalable, sensitive and applicable to wide variety of networks. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Canberra distance; Graph analytics; k-core decomposition; k-truss decomposition; Network comparison; Network similarity; Quantiles; Social networks; Structural hierarchy","Complex networks; Social networking (online); Topology; Canberra distances; Graph analytics; K-cores; Network comparisons; Quantiles; Structural hierarchies; Graph algorithms","Emmert-Streib F., Dehmer M., Shi Y., Fifty years of graph matching, network alignment and network comparison, Inform.

Although some static methods use multi-granularity subgraphs, they can hardly be applied to dynamic graphs. We propose a novel Temporal K-truss based Recurrent Graph Convolutional Network (TKRGCN) for dynamic link prediction, which learns graph embedding from different granularity subgraphs. Specifically, we employ k-truss decomposition to extract multi-granularity subgraphs which preserve both local and global structure information. Then we design a RNN framework to learn spatio-temporal graph embedding under different granularities.

In a nutshell, k-truss is the largest subgraph in which every edge is contained in at least k triangles. Truss decomposition aims to compute k-trusses for each possible value of k. There are many works that study truss decomposition in deterministic graphs. However, in probabilistic graphs, truss decomposition is significantly more challenging and has received much less attention; state-of-the-art approaches do not scale well to large probabilistic graphs. Finding the tail probabilities of the number of triangles that contain each edge is a critical challenge of those approaches. This is achieved using dynamic programming which has quadratic run-time and thus not scalable to real large networks which, quite commonly, can have edges contained in many triangles (in the millions). To address this challenge, we employ a special version of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to obtain the tail probabilities efficiently. Based on our CLT approach we propose a peeling algorithm for truss decomposition that scales to large probabilistic graphs and offers significant improvement over state-of-the-art. We also design a second method which progressively tightens the estimate of the truss value of each edge and is based on h-index computation. In contrast to our CLT-based approach, our h-index algorithm (1) is progressive by allowing the user to see near-results along the way, (2) does not sacrifice the exactness of final result, and (3) achieves all these while processing only one edge and its immediate neighbors at a time, thus resulting in smaller memory footprint. We perform extensive experiments to show the scalability of both of our proposed algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Dense subgraphs; Probabilistic graphs; Truss decomposition","Computation theory; Dynamic programming; Indexing (of information); Trusses; Central Limit Theorem; Dense sub-graphs; Deterministics; H indices; Probabilistic graphs; Probabilistics; State-of-the-art approach; Subgraphs; Tail probability; Truss decomposition; Graphic methods","Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, VLDB, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Zhao F., Tung A.K., Large scale cohesive subgraphs discovery for social network visual analysis, Proc.

The latest influence community search considers both the structural cohesion of the community and the influence between nodes. It sets the influence threshold to constrain the output community. However, artificially setting the influence threshold makes the output community too large or too small, which leads to low accuracy of the output community. In order to avoid the low accuracy of community search caused by artificially setting influence thresh-old constraints, this paper studies the community search problem based on community influence score. In this paper, an influence-truss community (ITC) model is proposed for community search by combining structural cohesion and community influence score. This model aims to obtain a connected subgraph in a social network containing the query node, which satisfies structural cohesion and satisfies the subgraph's maximum community in-fluence score. In order to obtain ITC, an effective pruning method is proposed, which strips other nodes far away from the query node. Then, the ITCS algorithm is designed, which firstly imposes structural cohesion constraints on query nodes. Then, the search community's influence scores are iteratively calculated until the community has the highest community influence score under the condition of meeting the structural cohesion. Experiments on real-world networks of different scales show that the community search accuracy index of ITCS is improved by about 20% compared with the traditional method. © 2022 IEEE.","community search; influential; k-truss; social network","Social networking (online); Trusses; Community model; Community search; Connected Subgraph; Influential; K-truss; Problem-based; Query nodes; Search problem; Social network; Subgraphs; Iterative methods","Newman M.E.J., Girvan M., Finding and evaluating community structure in networks, Physical Review E, 69, 2, (2004); Fortunato S., Community detection in graphs, Physics Reports, 486, 3-5, pp. 75-174, (2010); Li R., Yu J.X., Mao R., Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs, Ieee Trans.

But there is no previous study to consider the constraint of users' spatial information in k-truss search, denoted as co-located community search in this paper. The co-located community can serve many real applications. To search the maximum co-located communities efficiently, we first develop an efficient exact algorithm with several pruning techniques. After that, we further develop an approximation algorithm with adjustable accuracy guarantees and explore more effective pruning rules, which can reduce the computational cost significantly. To accelerate the real-time efficiency, we also devise a novel quadtree based index to support the efficient retrieval of users in a region and optimise the search regions with regards to the given query region. Finally, we verify the performance of our proposed algorithms and index using five real datasets. © 2018 VLDB Endowment 21508097/18/4.","","Trusses; Computational costs; Efficient exact algorithms; Highly-correlated; Pruning techniques; Real applications; Real data sets; Search region; Spatial informations; Approximation algorithms","Aggarwal A., Imai H., Katoh N., Suri S., Finding k points with minimum diameter and related problems, Journal of Algorithms, 12, 1, pp. 38-56, (1991); Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: a truss-equivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Akiba T., Iwata Y., Yoshida Y., Linear-time enumeration of maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs in large networks by random contraction, In CIKM, pp. 909-918, (2013); Cai G.-R., Sun Y.-G., The minimum augmentation of any graph to a k-edge-connected graph, Networks, pp. 151-172, (1989); Chang L., Yu J.X., Qin L., Lin X., Liu C., Liang W., Efficiently computing k-edge connected components via graph decomposition, In SIGMOD, pp. 205-216, (2013); Chen Y., Xu J., Xu M., Finding community structure in spatially constrained complex networks, International Journal of Geographical Information Science, 29, 6, pp. 889-911, (2015); Cheng J., Ke Y., Chu S., Zsu M.T., Efficient core decomposition in massive networks, In ICDE, pp. 51-62, (2011); Cheng J., Ke Y., Fu W.-C.A., Yu J.X., Zhu L., Finding maximal cliques in massive networks, ACM Trans.

Triangle-connected ktruss community (k-TTC) is a widely-used variant of k-truss, which is a maximal k-truss where edges can reach each other via a series of edge-adjacent triangles. Although existing works have provided indexes and query algorithms for k-TTC search, the cohesiveness of a k-TTC (diameter upper bound) has not been theoretically analyzed and the triangle connectivity has not been efficiently captured. Thus, we revisit the k-TTC search problem in dynamic graphs, aiming to achieve a deeper understanding of k-TTC. First, we prove that the diameter of a k-TTC with n vertices is bounded by ⌊ K+12n⌋. Then, we encapsulate triangle connectivity with two novel concepts, partial class and truss-precedence, based on which we build our compact index, EquiTree, to support the efficient k-TTC search. We also provide efficient index construction and maintenance algorithms for the dynamic change of graphs. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our extensive experiments show that EquiTree can boost search efficiency up to two orders of magnitude at a small cost of index construction and maintenance. © 2022, VLDB Endowment.

Current measures scrutinize either local or global connectivity of the nodes and have been found to be inadequate for social networks. Ignoring hierarchy and community structure, which are inherent in all human social networks, is the primary cause of this inadequacy. Positional hierarchy and embeddedness of an actor in the community are intuitively crucial determinants of his importance. The theory of social capital asserts that an actor’s importance is derived from his position in network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through intra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Inspired by this idea, we propose a novel centrality measure social centrality (SC) for actors in social networks. Our measure accounts for—(1) an individual’s propensity to socialize, and (2) his connections within and outside the community. These two factors are suitably aggregated to produce social centrality score. Comparative analysis of SC measure with classical and recent centrality measures using large public networks shows that it consistently produces more realistic ranking of nodes. The inference is based on the available ground truth for each tested networks. Extensive analysis of rankings delivered by SC measure and mapping with known facts in well-studied networks justifies its effectiveness in diverse social networks. Scalability evaluation of SC measure justifies its efficacy for real-world large networks. © 2018, The Author(s).","Centrality; Community; Hierarchy; k-Truss decomposition; Social capital; Strength of ties","Computer applications;

Discovering trusses in deterministic graphs has been widely discussed in the literature. However, with the intrinsic uncertainty in many networks such as social, biological, and communication networks, it is of great importance to study truss decomposition in a probabilistic context, but this has received much less attention till now. Furthermore, due to computation challenges of truss decomposition in probabilistic graphs, the state-of-the-art approaches are not scalable to large graphs. Given a user-defined threshold, we are interested in finding all the maximal subgraphs which are a k-truss with high probability. The most important challenge, which distinguishes truss decomposition in probabilistic graphs from deterministic graphs, is computing tail probabilities of edge supports. We employ a special version of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to obtain the tail probabilities efficiently. Based on our CLT approach we propose a peeling algorithm for truss decomposition of a probabilistic graph that scales to very large graphs and offers significant improvement over state-of-the-art. Our extensive experimental results confirm the scalability and efficiency of our approach. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","","Computation theory; Database systems; Graphic methods; Probability; Central Limit Theorem; Edge supports; High probability; Peeling algorithm; Probabilistic graphs; State of the art; State-of-the-art approach; Tail probability; Trusses","Boldi P., Vigna S., The webgraph framework I: Compression techniques, Proc.

Motivated by natural restrictions from real applications, in this paper, we investigate the search of triangle-connected k-truss with size constraint (denoted by SCkT) in a graph G: given a size constraint s, an integer k, and query set Q, SCkT search aims to find a triangle-connected k-truss H containing the vertices in Q and with size (i.e., total number of vertices in H) not exceeding s. We prove that the SCkT search problem is NP-hard. To tame the hardness, we fully exploit the properties of triangle-connected k-truss subgraphs s.t. a practically-efficient exact solution for SCkT search is developed. A novel and effective lower bound is proposed to early terminate unpromising search branches and narrow down the search space. Two search strategies, expansion and shrinking, are investigated to tailor for efficient support of SCkT search. A hybrid search method is proposed combining the expansion and shrinking strategies, where a score function is used to guide the search order. Our extensive experiments on real-life and synthetic graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the SCkT model and the efficiency of the proposed techniques. © 2021 IEEE.","Community search; K truss; Size constrained","NP-hard; Trusses; Bounded diameter; Exact solution; High connectivity; Real applications; Score function; Search strategies; Size constraint; Synthetic graphs; Graph theory","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A trussequivalence based indexing approach, Pvldb, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Bader D.A., Madduri K., Gtgraph: A Synthetic Graph Generator Suite, 38, (2006); Barabasi A.-L., Oltvai Z.N., Network biology: Understanding the cell's functional organization, Nature Reviews Genetics, 5, 2, (2004); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 29, 5, pp. 1406-1433, (2015); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An o(m) algorithm for cores decomposition of networks, CoRR, cs.DS/0310049, (2003); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., Short cycle connectivity, Discrete Mathematics, 307, 3-5, pp. 310-318, (2007); Chakrabarti D., Zhan Y., Faloutsos C., R-mat: A recursive model for graph mining, Icdm, pp. 442-446, (2004); Chang L., Lin X., Qin L., Yu J.X., Zhang W., Index-based optimal algorithms for computing steiner components with maximum connectivity, Sigmod, pp. 459-474, (2015); Chen X., Lai L., Qin L., Lin X., Structsim: Querying structural node similarity at billion scale, 36th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, Icde 2020, pp. 1950-1953, (2020); Chen X., Lai L., Qin L., Lin X., Liu B., A Framework to Quantify Approximate Simulation on Graph Data, (2020); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, 16, pp. 1-3, (2008); Coleman T.F., More J.J., Estimation of sparse jacobian matrices and graph coloring blems, Siam Journal on Numerical Analysis, 20, 1, pp. 187-209, (1983); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Wang W., Local search of communities in large graphs, Sigmod, pp. 991-1002, (2014); Dittrich M.T., Klau G.W., Rosenwald A., Dandekar T., Muller T., Identifying functional modules in protein-protein interaction networks: An integrated exact approach, Bioinformatics, 24, 13, pp. i223-i231, (2008); Erdos P., Renyi A., On the evolution of random graphs, Publ.

This paper surveys the optimizations applied to k-truss decomposition on GPUs, and presents KTRussExPLORER, a framework for exploring the design space formed by the combinations of these optimizations. Our evaluation shows that the best combination highly depends on the graph of choice, and analyses the conditions that make each optimization attractive.

Even the problem of computing most cohesive subgraphs is NP-hard (like clique, quasi-clique, k-densest subgraph), there exists a polynomial time algorithm for computing the k-core and k-truss. In this paper, we propose a novel dense subgraph model, k-core-truss, which leverages on a new type of important edges based on the basis of k-core and k-truss. We investigate the structural properties of the k-core-truss model. Compared to k-core and k-truss, k-core-truss can significantly discover the interesting and important structural information out the scope of k-core and k-truss. We study two useful problems of k-core-truss decomposition and k-core-truss search. In particular, we develop a k-core-truss decomposition algorithm to find all k-core-truss in a graph G by iteratively removing edges with the smallest degree-support. In addition, we offer a k-core-truss search algorithm to identifying a particular k-core-truss containing a given query node such that the core number k is the largest. Extensive experiments on several web-scale real-world datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of k-core-truss model and proposed algorithms. © 2018, The Author(s).","Cohesive subgraph model; Community search; k-core; k-core-truss; k-truss","","Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Catalyurek U.V., Finding the hierarchy of dense subgraphs using nucleus decompositions, International Conference on World Wide Web ACM, (2015); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, PVLDB, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying K-Truss Community in Large and Dynamic Graphs, SIGMOD; Li R., Qin L., Yu J.X., Mao R., Influential community search in large networks, PVLDB, 8, 5, pp. 509-520, (2015); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, Proc VLDB Endow, 9, 4, pp. 276-287, (2015); Buehrer G., Chellapilla K., A scalable pattern mining approach to web graph compression with communities, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Web Search and Data Mining, pp. 95-106, (2008); Dourisboure Y., Geraci F., Pellegrini M., Extraction and classification of dense communities in the web, In: Proceedings of the 16Th International Conference on World Wide Web, ACM, pp. 461-470, (2007); Angel A., Sarkas N., Koudas N., Srivastava D., Dense subgraph maintenance under streaming edge weight updates for real-time story identification, Proc VLDB Endow, 5, 6, pp. 574-585, (2012); Lee P., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Milios E., Cast:A context-aware story-teller for streaming socail content, In: Proceedings of the 23Rd ACM International Conference on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management ACM, (2014); Fratkin E., Naughton B.T., Brutlag D.L., Batzoglou S., Motifcut: regulatory motifs finding with maximum density subgraphs, Bioinformatics, 22, 14, pp. e150-e157, (2006); Alvarez-Hamelin J.I., Dall'Asta L., Barrat A., Vespignani A., Large scale networks fingerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 41-50, (2005); Cohen E., Halperin E., Kaplan H., Zwick U., Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels, SIAM J Comput, 32, 5, pp. 1338-1355, (2003); Jin R., Xiang Y., Ruan N., Fuhry D., 3-hop: A high-compression indexing scheme for reachability query, Proceedings of the 2009 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 813-826, (2009); Luce R.D., Perry A.D., A method of matrix analysis of group structure, Psychometrika, 14, 2, pp. 95-116, (1949); Bron C., Kerbosch J., Algorithm 457: finding all cliques of an undirected graph, Commun ACM, 16, 9, pp. 575-577, (1973); Seidman S.B., Foster B.L., A graph-theoretic generalization of the clique concept*, J Math Sociol, 6, 1, pp. 139-154, (1978); Mokken R.J., Cliques, clubs and clans, Quality & Quantity, 13, 2, pp. 161-173, (1979); Abello J., Resende M.G., Sudarsky S., Massive quasi-clique detection, In: Latin American Symposium on Theoretical Informatics, Springer, pp. 598-612, (2002); Charikar M., Greedy approximation algorithms for finding dense components in a graph, International Workshop on Approximation Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization, pp. 84-95, (2000); Lawler E.L., Combinatorial Optimization: Networks and Matroids, (2001); Khuller S., Saha B., On finding dense subgraphs, In: International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming, Springer, pp. 597-608, (2009); Cheng J., Ke Y., Chu S., Ozsu M.T., Efficient core decomposition in massive networks, In: ICDE, (2011); Wen D., Qin L., Zhang Y., Lin X., Yu J.X., I/O Efficient Core Graph Decomposition at Web Scale, (2016); Seidman S.B., Network structure and minimum degree, Soc Netw, 5, 3, pp. 269-287, (1983); Trusses C.J., Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis; Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An O(M) algorithm for cores decomposition of networks; Montresor A., Pellegrini F.D., Miorandi D., Distributed k-core decomposition, IEEE Trans Parallel Distrib Syst, 24, 2, pp. 288-300, (2013); Carmi S., Havlin S., Kirkpatrick S., Shavitt Y., Shir E., A model of internet topology using k-shell decomposition, PNAS, 104, 27, pp. 11150-11154, (2007); Li R., Yu J.X., Mao R., Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs, IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng, 26, 10, pp. 2453-2465, (2014); Zhao F., Tung A.K.H., Large scale cohesive subgraphs discovery for social network visual analysis, PVLDB, 6, 2, pp. 85-96, (2012); Zhou R., Liu C., Yu J.X., Liang W., Zhang Y., Efficient truss maintenance in evolving networks, Eprint Arxiv, 14, pp. 402-407, (2014); Huang X., Lu W., Lakshmanan L.V., Truss Decomposition of Probabilistic Graphs: Semantics and Algorithms","Z.

Among them, a large amount of data in the field of academics includes rich and diverse entity information such as high-quality academic papers, experts, venues, and topics that have intricate and complex relationships, constituting important heterogeneous academic networks, e.g., DBLP. Many expert finding systems have been investigated on the academic network. But most of them are using textual keyword matching techniques to support the systems. Different from the above systems, we designed and implemented an expert finding system to effectively and efficiently return desired experts not only based on textual keyword matching, but also on the experts' relationship achieved by community search. It contains three layers: data processing layer, core algorithm layer, and application layer. The data processing layer is responsible for data collection and processing to construct heterogeneous academic networks. The core algorithm layer includes the academic network community search algorithm and Top-n expert finding through multiple recalls based on the Threshold algorithm. The application layer receives data from the core algorithm layer to present to users at the front end. On this basis, our core algorithms can also be migrated to other applications, e.g., recommendation, biological data analysis, reviewer assignment, and public safety protection.  © 2022 IEEE.","Elastic Search; Expert finding; k-Truss; multiple recall","Bioinformatics; Network layers; Search engines; Application layers; Core algorithms; Elastic search; Expert finding; Expert finding systems; Explosive growth; K-truss; Key word matching; Multiple recall; Processing layer; Data handling","Sun Y., Han J., Yan X., Yu P.S., Wu T., Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks, Proc.

GBTLX refactors code written using GBTL into problems that capture the signature of algorithms and solvers that capture the semantics (input/output behavior of algorithms. Users provide classes that implement these two aspects using standard GBTL functions and encapsulate the targeted algorithm. GBTLX then performs a sequence of inspection, code generation, and high-performance execution. First, the user code is traced while running with the original GBTL. Then, the trace is used to define the semantics and signature of the algorithm to be produced in code generation. The SPIRAL system is used to generate high-performance C code that implements the user-specified algorithm, specializing the code for algorithm and hardware-dependent optimizations. Finally, the user-provided GBTL-based implementation is replaced by the SPIRAL generated C code. For triangle counting and k-truss enumeration, the resulting executables provide performance equivalent to hand-tuned implementations, while the source code is maintainable as it only uses the C++ GBTL library.  © 2020 IEEE.","","Cryptography; Semantics; Code Generation; Code generators; Executables; First look; Graph processing; Input/output behaviors; Source codes; Template libraries; C++ (programming language)","Beamer S., Asanovic K., Patterson D., The Gap Benchmark Suite, (2015); Kepner J., Gilbert J., Graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra, Siam, (2011); Buluc A., Mattson T., McMillan S., Moreira J., Yang C., Design of the graphblas api for c, 2017 Ieee International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops IPDPSW, pp. 643-652, (2017); Kepner J., Aaltonen P., Bader D., Buluc A., Franchetti F., Gilbert J., Hutchison D., Kumar M., Lumsdaine A., Meyerhenke H., Et al., Mathematical foundations of the graphblas, 2016 Ieee High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC, pp. 1-9, (2016); GraphBLAS Template Library (Gbtl), Version 3.0; Franchetti F., Low T.M., Popovici D.T., Veras R.M., Spampinato D.G., Johnson J.R., Puschel M., Hoe J.C., Moura J.M.F., Spiral: Extreme performance portability, Proceedings of the Ieee, 106, 11, pp. 1935-1968, (2018); Puschel M., Franchetti F., Voronenko Y., Encyclopedia of Parallel Computing, (2011); Puschel M., Moura J.M.F., Johnson J., Padua D., Veloso M., Ryan Singer B., Xiong J., Franchetti F., Gacic A., Voronenko Y., Chen K., Johnson R.W., Rizzolo N., Spiral: Code generation for dsp transforms, Proceedings of the IEEE, Special Issue on ""program Generation, Optimization, and Adaptation, 93, 2, pp. 232-275, (2005); Low T.M., Rao V.N., Lee M., Popovici D., Franchetti F., McMillan S., First look: Linear algebra-based triangle counting without matrix multiplication, 2017 Ieee High Performance Extreme Computing Conference HPEC, pp. 1-6, (2017); Blanco M., Low T.M., Kim K., Exploration of fine-grained parallelism for load balancing eager k-truss on gpu and cpu, 2019 Ieee High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC, pp. 1-7, (2019); Zhang Y., Yang M., Baghdadi R., Kamil S., Shun J., Amarasinghe S., Graphit: A high-performance graph dsl, Proceedings of the Acm on Programming Languages, 2, pp. 1-30, (2018); Nguyen D., Lenharth A., Pingali K., A lightweight infrastructure for graph analytics, Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Acm Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, pp. 456-471, (2013); Spiral Project; Franchetti F., Spampinato D.G., Kulkarni A., Popovici D.T., Low T.M., Franusich M., Canning A., McCorquodale P., Van Straalen B., Colella P., Fftx and spectralpack: A first look, 2018 Ieee 25th International Conference on High Performance Computing Workshops HiPCW, pp. 18-27, (2018); Parimalarangan S., Slota G.M., Madduri K., Fast parallel graph triad census and triangle counting on shared-memory platforms, 2017 Ieee International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW, pp. 1500-1509, (2017); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172819219-2","","","English","IEEE High Perform.

Two users are more likely to build the friendship if they share some common friends. Meanwhile, the breakdown or enhancement of critical connections may lead to a cascaded phenomenon and cause the social network collapsed or reinforced. In this paper, we leverage the k-truss model to measure the stability of a social network. To identify the critical edges, we propose two novel problems named k-truss minimization problem and k-truss maximization problem. Given a social network G, a positive integer k and a budget b, it aims to find b edges for deletion (resp. addition), which can lead to the maximum number of edges collapsed (resp. added) in the k-truss of G. We prove that both problems are NP-hard. To accelerate the computation, novel pruning rules and searching paradigms are developed for the corresponding problem. Comprehensive experiments are conducted over 9 real-life networks to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed models and approaches. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Critical edge; k-truss; Maximization; Minimization; NP-hard","Budget control; NP-hard; Critical connections; Critical edges; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Maximization problem; Minimization problems; Positive integers; Real-life networks; Truss model; Trusses","Bhawalkar K., Kleinberg J., Lewi K., Roughgarden T., Sharma A., Preventing unraveling in social networks: the anchored k-core problem, SIAM J.

However, existing well-studied approaches aim at finding compact trees/subgraphs containing the keywords, and ignore a critical measure, density, to reflect how strongly and stablely the keyword nodes are connected in the substructure. In this paper, we study the problem of finding a cohesive subgraph containing the query keywords based on the k-Truss model, and formulate it as minimal dense truss search problem, i.e., finding minimal subgraph with maximum trussness covering the keywords. We first propose an efficient algorithm to find the dense truss with the maximum trussness containing keywords based on a novel hybrid KT-Index (Keyword-Truss Index).

It starts with some given nodes, pays more attention to local network structures, and gets personalized resultant communities quickly. In this paper, we argue that there are many real scenarios where some nodes are not allowed to appear in the community. Then, we introduce a new concept called forbidden nodes and present a new problem of forbidden nodes aware community search to describe these scenarios. To address the above problem, three methods are proposed, i.e., k-core based FORTE (Forbidden nOdes awaRe communiTy sEarch), k-truss based FORTE and CW based FORTE, where the effects of both forbidden nodes and query nodes are thoroughly considered for each node in the resultant community. The former two methods are able to make use of popular community structures, while the latter is based on a new metric called weighted conductance. The extensive experiments conducted on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

But, most of previous researches ignore the influence among nodes. This lead to inaccuracy in many scenes where it requires communities with high expansibility. Some researches may consider the influence in community search, but they ignore the attributes cohesion of community. In this paper, we study community search problem and propose an influential attribute community search method based on both influence and attribute features. Our method can find the attributed pk-truss community with largest attribute and influence relevance score function. Most of the community models adopt k-core or k-clique. But k-core has weaker structural tightness than that of k-truss, and k-clique has a strong rule and high computation complexity. So in our method, we first present attributed pk-truss community model based on k-truss. Then we propose a novel score function to check the cohesion of the community. This function can consider both the influence features and attribute features of the community. So it can improve the accuracy of searching results. Besides, to conduct influential attribute community search in large network, our method introduces graph refining method. Experiments on two large networks with ground-truth communities show the quality evaluation, effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. © 2019 IEEE.","community search; graph refining; influential attribute community; pk truss community model","Refining; Smart city; Trusses; Community model; community search; Computation complexity; Effectiveness and efficiencies; influential attribute community; Large networks; Quality evaluation; Relevance score; Data communication systems","Li J., Wang X., Deng K., Yang X., Sellis T., Yu J.X., Most influential community search over large social networks, 2017 IEEE 33rd International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE), pp. 871-882, (2017); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Attribute-driven community search, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 10, 9, pp. 949-960, (2017); Xu J., Fu X., Tu L., Luo M., Xu M., Zheng N., Personalized top-n influential community search over large social networks, Asia-Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) Joint International Conference on Web and Big Data, pp. 105-120, (2018); Leskovec J., Lang K.J., Mahoney M., Empirical comparison of algorithms for network community detection, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 631-640, (2010); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, 16, pp. 3-11, (2008); Chiba N., Nishizeki T., Arboricity and subgraph listing algorithms, SIAM Journal on Computing, 14, 1, pp. 210-223, (1985); Fang Y., Et al., Effective community search for large attributed graphs, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9, 12, pp. 1233-1244, (2016); Lu Z., Wen Y., Cao G., Community detection in weighted networks: Algorithms and applications, 2013 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom), pp. 179-184, (2013); Weiss R.S., Jacobson E., A method for the analysis of the structure of complex organizations, American Sociological Review, 20, 6, pp. 661-668, (1955); Satuluri V., Parthasarathy S., Scalable graph clustering using stochastic flows: Applications to community discovery, Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 737-746, (2009); Wu Q., Hao J.-K., A review on algorithms for maximum clique problems, European Journal of Operational Research, 242, 3, pp. 693-709, (2015); Azimi-Tafreshi N., Gomez-Gardenes J., Dorogovtsev S.N., K core percolation on multiplex networks, Physical Review e, 90, 3, (2014); Andersen R., Peres Y., Finding sparse cuts locally using evolving sets, Proceedings of the Forty-first Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 235-244, (2009); Chen P.-L., Chou C., Chen M., Distributed algorithms for k-Truss decomposition, 2014 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (Big Data), pp. 471-480, (2014); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Lu Y., Wang W., Online search of overlapping communities, Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 277-288, (2013); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 29, 5, pp. 1406-1433, (2015); Sozio M., Gionis A., The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 939-948, (2010); Li R.-H., Qin L., Ye F., Xu Yu J., Xiao X., Xiao N., Zheng Z., Skyline community search in multivalued networks, Proceedings of the 2018 International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 457-472, (2018); Chen L., Liu C., Zhou R., Li J., Yang X., Wang B., Maximum co-located community search in large scale social networks, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 11, 10, pp. 1233-1246, (2018); Yang J., Leskovec J., Defining and evaluating network communities based on ground-Truth, Knowledge and Information Systems, 42, 1, pp. 181-213, (2015); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9, 4, pp. 276-287, (2015)","","Xiao Z.; Yang L.T.; Balaji P.; Li T.; Li K.; Zomaya A.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172812058-4","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

Existing solutions mainly focus on homogeneous networks, where vertices are of the same type, and thus cannot be applied to heterogeneous information networks which consist of multi-typed and interconnected objects, such as the bibliographic networks and knowledge graphs. In this paper, we study the problem of truss computation over HINs, which aims to find groups of vertices that are of the same type and densely connected.To model the relationship between two vertices of the same type, we adopt the well-known concept of meta-path, which is a sequence of vertex types and edge types between two given vertex types. We then introduce two kinds of HIN triangles for three vertices, regarding a specific meta-path P. The first one requires that each pair of vertices is connected by an instance of P, while the second one also has such a connectivity constraint but further needs that the three instances of P form a circle. Based on these two kinds of triangles, we propose two HIN truss models respectively. We further develop efficient truss computation algorithms. We have performed extensive experiments on five real large HINs, and the results show that the proposed solutions are highly effective and efficient. © 2020 IEEE.","","Information services; Trusses; Computation algorithm; Connectivity constraints; Heterogeneous information; Homogeneous network; Knowledge graphs; Subgraphs; Truss model; Computational efficiency","Sun Y., Han J., Yan X., Yu P.S., Wu T., Pathsim: Meta path-based top-k similarity search in heterogeneous information networks, PVLDB, 4, 11, pp. 992-1003, (2011); Fang Y., Huang X., Qin L., Zhang Y., Zhang W., Cheng R., Lin X., A survey of community search over big graphs, VLDBJ, (2019); Seidman S.B., Network structure and minimum degree, Social Networks, 5, pp. 269-287, (1983); Cheng J., Ke Y., Chu S., Ozsu M.T., Efficient core decomposition in massive networks, ICDE, pp. 51-62, (2011); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis, (2008); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, PVLDB, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Chang L., Yu J.X., Qin L., Lin X., Liu C., Liang W., Efficiently computing k-edge connected components via graph decomposition, SIGMOD, pp. 205-216, (2013); Cheng J., Zhu L., Ke Y., Chu S., Fast algorithms for maximal clique enumeration with limited memory, SIGKDD, pp. 1240-1248, (2012); Abello J., Resende M.G.C., Sudarsky S., Massive quasi-clique detection, Latin: Theoretical Informatics, 5th Latin American Symposium, pp. 598-612, (2002); Takaguchi T., Yoshida Y., Cycle and flow trusses in directed networks, Royal Society Open Science, 3, (2016); Opsahl T., Triadic closure in two-mode networks: Redefining the global and local clustering coefficients, Social Networks-SOC NETWORKS, 35, (2010); Sun Y., Barber R., Gupta M., Aggarwal C.C., Han J., Coauthor relationship prediction in heterogeneous bibliographic networks, ASONAM, pp. 121-128, (2011); Lao N., Cohen W.W., Relational retrieval using a combination of path-constrained random walks, Machine Learning, 81, 1, pp. 53-67, (2010); Huang Z., Zheng Y., Cheng R., Sun Y., Mamoulis N., Li X., Meta structure: Computing relevance in large heterogeneous information networks, SIGKDD, pp. 1595-1604, (2016); Yang Y., Fang Y., Lin X., Zhang W., Effictive Truss Computation over Large Heterogeneous Information Networks; Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs, SIGMOD, pp. 1311-1322, (2014); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, PVLDB, (2015); Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A trussequivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, (2017); Fang Y., Cheng R., Li X., Luo S., Hu J., Effective community search over large spatial graphs, PVLDB, 10, (2017); Fang Y., Cheng R., Luo S., Hu J., Effective community search for large attributed graphs, PVLDB, 9, (2016); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Attribute-driven community search, PVLDB, (2017); Fang Y., Yang Y., Zhang W., Lin X., Cao X., Effective and efficient community search over large heterogeneous information networks, PVLDB, (2020); Chang L., SIGKDD, pp. 529-538, (2019); Zhou R., Liu C., Yu J.X., Liang W., Chen B., Li J., Finding maximal k-edge-connected subgraphs from a large graph, EDBT, pp. 480-491, (2012); Fang Y., Yu K., Cheng R., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Lin X., Efficient algorithms for densest subgraph discovery, PVLDB, (2019); Gionis A., Tsourakakis C.E., Dense subgraph discovery: KDD 2015 tutorial, SIGKDD, pp. 2313-2314, (2015); Conte A., Matteis T.D., Sensi D.D., Grossi R., Marino A., Versari L., D2K: Scalable community detection in massive networks via small-diameter k-plexes, SIGKDD, (2018); Cohen J., Graph twiddling in a mapreduce world, Computing in Science and Engineering, 11, 4, pp. 29-41, (2009); Tixier A.J., Malliaros F.D., Vazirgiannis M., A graph degeneracybased approach to keyword extraction, EMNLP, (2016); Ghalmane Z., Hassouni M.E., Cherifi C., Cherifi H., K-truss decomposition for modular centrality, ISIVC, pp. 241-248, (2018); Chen P., Chou C., Chen M., Distributed algorithms for k-truss decomposition, IEEE International Conference on Big Data, (2014); Kabir H., Madduri K., Shared-memory graph truss decomposition, HiPC, pp. 13-22, (2017); Zhou R., Liu C., Yu J.X., Liang W., Zhang Y., Efficient Truss Maintenance in Evolving Networks, (2014); Zhang Y., Yu J.X., Unboundedness and efficiency of truss maintenance in evolving graphs, SIGMOD, (2019)","Y.

K-truss as a community model has drawn increasing attention in the literature. In this work, we extend our scope from the community search problems to a more generalized local community query problem based on a triangle- connected k-truss community model. We classify local community query into two categories, community-level and edge-level query, based on the information required to process a given query. We design a two-level index structure that supports both types of queries with multiple query vertices and arbitrary cohesiveness criteria. We conduct extensive experiments using real-world large-scale graphs and compare with the state-of-the-art methods of k-truss community search.

A number of approaches have been made to solve this challenging problem using different quality functions and data structures. A number of cohesive structures have been defined as a primary element for community discovery in networks. Unfortunately, most of these structures suffer from computational intractability and they fail to mine meaningful communities from real-world graphs. The main objective of the paper is to exploit some cohesive structures in one unified framework to detect high-quality communities in networks. First, we revisit some existing subgraph models by showing their limits in terms of cohesiveness, which is an elementary aspect in graph theory. Next, to make these structures more effective models of communities, we focus on interesting configurations that are larger and more densely connected by fulfilling some new constraints. The new structures allow to ensure a larger density on the discovered clusters and overcome the weaknesses of the existing structures. The performance studies demonstrate that our approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art techniques for computing overlapping communities in real-world networks by several orders of magnitude. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graph mining; k-edge-connected component; k-truss; Overlapping community detection","Computation theory; Information services; Community-based; Connected component; Graph data; Graph mining; In networks; K-edge-connected component; K-truss; Overlapping communities; Overlapping community detections; Subgraphs; Graph theory","Adamcsek B., Palla G., Farkas I.J., Derenyi I., Vicsek T., Cfinder: Locating cliques and overlapping modules in biological networks, Bioinformatics, 22, 8, pp. 1021-1023, (2006); Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, Proc.

A private graph consists of personal private contacts that only can be visible to its owner, e.g., hidden friend lists on Facebook and secret following on Sina Weibo. However, existing public-private analytic algorithms have not yet investigated the dense subgraph discovery of k-truss, where each edge is contained in at least k − 2 triangles. This paper aims at finding k-truss efficiently in public-private graphs. The core of our solution is a novel algorithm to update k-truss with node insertions. We develop a classification-based hybrid strategy of node insertions and edge insertions to incrementally compute k-truss in public-private graphs. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our proposed algorithms against state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. © 2019 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Block access pattern prediction is a key part of the prefetching algorithm. However, existing block access pattern prediction methods cannot achieve the goals of low overhead, real-time, and self- adaptability at the same time. In this paper, we propose a real-time prediction method, called KBP (K-Truss-based Block access pattern Prediction). KBP uses SA (Sequential Access) Filter to identify and filter sequential access patterns to distinguish different patterns. Then, KBP uses K-Truss dense subgraph algorithm to detect compound access patterns, so as to use the time and space advantages of the K-Truss algorithm to reduce the overhead of access pattern recognition and make it possible for KBP to run in real time. Furthermore, KBP uses online reinforcement learning to achieve the goal of self- adaptability. We evaluate KBP in real-world workloads and the results show that KBP can improve the hit rate of 11.2% compared to the state-of-the-art prefetching algorithms on average. © 2021 IEEE.","Access pattern; Block storage; K-Truss dense sub-graph; Prefetching","Filtration; Reinforcement learning; Trusses; Access patterns; Block storage; Dense sub-graphs; K-truss dense sub-graph; Key parts; Prefetching; Prefetching algorithm; Self-adaptability; Sequential access; Storage systems; Forecasting","Weil S.A., Brandt S.A., Miller E.L., Long D.D., Maltzahn C., Ceph: A scalable, high-performance distributed file system, Proceedings of the 7th Symposium on Operating Systems Design and Implementation, pp. 307-320, (2006); Zhu C., Wang F., Hou B., Bpp: A realtime block access pattern mining scheme for i/o prediction, Proceedings of the 48th International Conference on Parallel Processing, pp. 1-10, (2019); Li Z., Chen Z., Srinivasan S.M., Zhou Y., Et al., C-miner: Mining block correlations in storage systems, FAST, 4, pp. 173-186, (2004); Soundararajan G., Mihailescu M., Amza C., Context-aware prefetching at the storage server, USENIX Annual Technical Conference, pp. 377-390, (2008); Griffioen J., Appleton R., Reducing file system latency using a predictive approach, USENIX Summer, pp. 197-207, (1994); Yang S., Srinivasan K., Udayashankar K., Krishnan S., Feng J., Zhang Y., Arpaci-Dusseau A.C., Arpaci-Dusseau R.H., Tombolo: Performance enhancements for cloud storage gateways, 2016 32nd Symposium on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies (MSST).

It is the definition of community structure that the connection of nodes in the community is dense with the connection of nodes outside the community is sparse, which is corresponding to the core structure in the complex real networks is represented by a compact and dense set of connected nodes. While all the notes in the network are considered by the traditional topology, it is hard to extract the core structure with the continuous, exponential growth of community networks. In this paper, a novel network core structure extraction algorithm utilized variational autoencoder for community detection(CSEA) is proposed for finding the community structure more accurately. Firstly, the K-truss algorithm is used to find the core structure information in the network, and the similarity matrix is generated by similarity mapping combined with local information. Secondly, the variational autoencoder is used to extract and reduce the dimension of the similarity matrix containing the core structure of the network, and the low-dimensional feature matrix is obtained. Finally, the K-means clustering algorithm is utilized to obtain the community structure information. We compare CSEA algorithm with 18 different types of community detection algorithms using 4 evaluation metrics on 19 complex real networks. By extensively evaluating our algorithm on large real-world datasets, we show that CSEA algorithm has an excellent community division effect in dense complex real networks, especially in small and medium-sized networks, and it can accurately divide the complex real networks with unknown community structure.

When applied to sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are equivalent to computations on graphs. GraphBLAS provides a powerful and expressive framework for creating graph algorithms based on the elegant mathematics of sparse matrix operations on a semiring.

A plethora of centrality measures have been proposed over the years based on the topological properties of networks. However, most of these classical centrality measures fail to select the most influential nodes in networks with a modular structure despite that it is an omnipresent property in real-world networks. Few authors have introduced centrality measures tailored to networks with community structure. In a recent work, we have shown that, in this case, the centrality of a node should be represented by a two-dimensional vector. The first component quantifies the local influence of the node in its community, while the second component quantifies the global influence of the node on the communities which it is linked to. In order to compute the so-called modular centrality, one needs to know the community structure of the network. Unfortunately, in most cases, it is unknown and a community detection algorithm must be used. The majority of these algorithms are computationally intensive and sometimes they are inappropriate for large networks. In this paper, a community detection method based on the k-truss decomposition is used. Thanks to its nice structural and computational properties, it is well-adapted to large networks. Furthermore, we present a new ranking measure based on the weighted combination of both components of the modular centrality.

Mining cohesive subgraphs is a fundamental problem in graph analysis, while implementing cohesive subgraphs requires analysts to not only ensure cohesiveness but also consider the computational intractability. Among a variety of diverse cohesive structures, k-truss exhibits a perfect trade-off between structure tightness and computational efficiency. In a k-truss, each edge is present in at least k-2 triangles. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of truss maintenance in fully dynamic graphs by avoiding expensive re-computation. Specifically, we consider the challenging scenario of batch processing of edge and vertex insertion/deletion and propose efficient algorithms that can maintain the trusses by only searching a very small range of affected edges. Also, our algorithms allow parallel implementations to further improve the efficiency of maintenance. Extensive experiments on both real-world static and temporal graphs illustrate the efficiency and scalability of our algorithms.  © 1968-2012 IEEE.","Graph analysis; mixed structure; truss maintenance","Batch data processing; Computational efficiency; Economic and social effects; Job analysis; Maintenance; Online systems; Social networking (online); Trusses; Batch production; Batch production system; Collaboration; Graph analysis; Heuristics algorithm; Mixed structure; Production system; Social networking (online); Task analysis; Truss maintenance; Verylarge-scale integrations (VLSI); Heuristic algorithms","Cai Z., He Z., Guan X., Li Y., Collective data-sanitization for preventing sensitive information inference attacks in social networks, IEEE Trans.

However, existing works suffer from two major limitations: (i) it is not easy to set the conditions on query attributes; (ii) the queries support only a single type of attributes. To make up for these deficiencies, in this paper, we study a novel attributed community search called vertex-centric attributed community (VAC) search. Given an attributed graph and a query vertex set, the VAC search returns the community which is densely connected (ensured by the k-truss model) and has the best attribute score. We show that the problem is NP-hard. To answer the VAC search, we develop both exact and approximate algorithms. Specifically, we develop two exact algorithms. One searches the community in a depth-first manner and the other is in a best-first manner. We also propose a set of heuristic strategies to prune the unqualified search space by exploiting the structure and attribute properties. In addition, to further improve the search efficiency, we propose a 2-approximation algorithm. Comprehensive experimental studies on various realworld attributed graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and the efficiency of the developed algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.","","Efficiency; Graph structures; Approximate algorithms; Attributed graphs; Depth first; Exact algorithms; Heuristic strategy; Search efficiency; Search spaces; Truss model; Graph algorithms","Sozio M., Gionis A., The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party, SIGKDD, pp. 939-948, (2010); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Wang W., Local search of communities in large graphs, SIGMOD, pp. 991-1002, (2014); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, Data Min.

A subgraph is a k-truss (k ≥ 2) if each edge is in at least k-2 triangles in the subgraph. Existing algorithms work by first counting the number of triangles each edge is in and then iteratively incrementing k to peel off the edges that will not appear in (k + 1)-truss. Due to the data and computation intensity, truss decomposition on billion-edge graphs takes hours to complete on a commodity computer. We propose to accelerate in-memory truss decomposition by (1) compacting intermediate results to optimize memory access, (2) dynamically adjusting the computation based on data characteristics, and (3) parallelizing the algorithm on both the multicore CPU and the GPU. In particular, we optimize the triangle enumeration with data skew handling, and determine at runtime whether to pursue peeling or direct triangle counting to obtain a certain k-truss. We further develop a CPU-GPU co-processing strategy in which the CPU first computes intermediate results and sends the compacted results to the GPU for further computation. Our experiments on real-world datasets show that our implementations outperform the state of the art by up to an order of magnitude.

Most community search models consider link structure and ignore link weight while answering the required queries. Given the importance of link weight in different networks, this paper considers both link structure and link weight to discover top-r weighted k-truss communities via community search. The top-weighted k-truss communities are those communities with the highest weight and the highest cohesiveness within the network. All recent studies that considered link weight discover top-weighted communities via global search and index-based search techniques. In this paper three different algorithms are proposed to scale-up the existing approaches of weighted community search via local search. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the existing state-of-the-art algorithms over different datasets in terms of search time by several orders of magnitude. © 2022, The Author(s).","Community search; k-truss community detection model; Weighted graph","","Cohen J., Trusses: cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, Natl Secur Agency Tech Rep, 16, pp. 1-3, (2008); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, Proc VLDB Endow, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Li R.H., Qin L., Yu J.X., Mao R., Influential community search in large networks, Proc VLDB Endow, 8, 5, pp. 509-520, (2015); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Wang W., Local Search of Communities in Large Graphs, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data.

For single k k-truss implementation, we propose multiple algorithmic optimizations that significantly improve performance by up to 35.2x (6.9x on average) compared to our previous GPU implementation. In addition, we present a scalable multi-GPU implementation in which each GPU handles a different 'k' value. Compared to our prior multi-GPU implementation, the proposed approach is faster by up to 151.3x (78.8x on average). In case when the edges with only maximal k-truss are sought, incrementing the 'k' value in each iteration is inefficient particularly for graphs with large maximum k-truss. Thus, we propose binary search for the 'k' value to find the maximal k-truss. The binary search approach on a single GPU is up to 101.5 (24.3x on average) faster than our 2018 k-truss submission. Lastly, we show that the proposed binary search finds the maximum k-truss for 'Twitter' graph dataset having 2.8 billion bidirectional edges in just 16 minutes on a single V100 GPU. © 2019 IEEE.","Binary search; CUDA; GPU; K-truss decomposition; Multi-GPU; Multi-node","Graphics processing unit; Iterative methods; Algorithmic optimization; Bidirectional edges; Binary search; CUDA; GPU implementation; Improve performance; Multi-gpu; Multi-nodes; Trusses","Mailthody V.S., Date K., Qureshi Z., Pearson C., Nagi R., Xiong J., Hwu W., Collaborative (cpu + GPU) algorithms for triangle counting and truss decomposition, 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-7, (2018); Pearce R., Sanders G., K-truss decomposition for scale-free graphs at scale in distributed memory, 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-6, (2018); Bisson M., Fatica M., Update on static graph challenge on GPU, 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-8, (2018); Low T.M., Spampinato D.G., Kutuluru A., Sridhar U., Popovici D.T., Franchetti F., McMillan S., Linear algebraic formulation of edgecentric k-truss algorithms with adjacency matrices, 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-7, (2018); Conte A., De Sensi D., Grossi R., Marino A., Versari L., Discoveringk-trusses in large-scale networks, 2018 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-6, (2018); Voegele C., Lu Y., Pai S., Pingali K., Parallel triangle counting and k-truss identification using graph-centric methods, 2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-7, (2017); Smith S., Liu X., Ahmed N.K., Tom A.S., Petrini F., Karypis G., Truss decomposition on shared-memory parallel systems, 2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-6, (2017); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis, (2008); Bisson M., Fatica M., Static graph challenge on GPU, 2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-8, (2017); Merrill D., Cub, (2016); (2019); Kwak H., Lee C., Park H., Moon S., What is twitter, a social network or a news media?, Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 591-600, (2010)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172815020-8","","","English","IEEE High Perform.

CS has gained much research interests recently. In the database research community, researchers aim to find the most cohesive subgraph satisfying a specific community model (e.g., k-core or k-truss) via graph traversal. These works obtain good precision, however suffering from the low efficiency issue. In the AI research community, a new thought of using the deep learning model to support CS without relying on graph traversal emerges. Supervised end-to-end models using GCN are presented, which perform efficiently, but leave a large room for precision improvement. None of them can achieve a good balance between the efficiency and effectiveness. This motivates our solution: First, we present an offline community-injected graph embedding method to preserve the community's cohesiveness features into the learned node representations. Second, we resort to a proximity graph (PG) built from node representations, to quickly return the community online. Moreover, we develop a self-augmented method based on KL divergence to further optimize node representations. Extensive experiments on seven real-world graphs show our solution's superiority on effectiveness (at least 39.3% improvement) and efficiency (one to two orders of magnitude faster). © 2023 The Authors.","","Deep learning; Graph embeddings; Graph theory; Query processing; Community model; Database research; Graph embeddings; Graph G; Graph traversals; K-cores; Query nodes; Research communities; Research interests; Subgraphs; Efficiency","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, Data Min.

Recent study showed that the K-truss decomposition could filter out the nodes that performed a worse spreading behavior in the maximal K-shell subgraph. The spreaders belonging to the maximal K-truss subgraph show better performance compared to previously used importance criteria. However, the accuracy of the K-truss or the K-shell in determining node coreness is largely susceptible to core-like group. In this paper, we propose an improved diffusion K-truss decomposition method by considering both the diffusion and clustering of edges to eliminate the impact of core-like group on identifying influential nodes. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare it with five typical methods by carrying out Monte-Carlo simulations over six real complex networks. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively disintegrate the core-like group and accurately identify the influential nodes. © 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.","complex networks; edge clustering; edge diffusion; K-truss decomposition","","Carmi S., Et al., Proc.

One of the limitations of many current community search models is that detected communities may include irrelevant nodes, called the 'free riders'. In this paper, we study the community search problem in the truss-based closest community model aimed to discover community for a given query set with avoiding the free rider effect. The Closest Truss Community (CTC) is a densely connected k-truss subgraph that contains the query nodes and has the smallest diameter. We use a greedy approach and propose a Truss EQuivalence based index graph (TEQ) that supports the search of closest trust community. To further improve the efficiency of the search, we create a maximum spanning tree of TEQ, as an index tree. We also propose an early pruning algorithm to improve the efficiency of free rider elimination. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks validate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms over the state-of-the-art methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Community Search; Graph Indexing; MST; Query Processing","Big data; Efficiency; Indexing (materials working); Query processing; Trusses; Community Search; Connected subgraphs; Graph indexing; Greedy approaches; Maximum spanning tree; Real-world networks; State-of-the-art methods; Trust communities; Graph theory","Fortunato S., Community detection in graphs, Physics Reports, 486, 3-5, pp. 75-174, (2010); Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A trussequivalence based indexing approach, Proc.

Our goal is to offer a simple vectorisation approach which can be easily implemented in widely popular Python vector libraries, such as NumPy. This way has two advantages: (1) non-experts with basic knowledge of Python can implement our algorithm, and (2) they can obtain multi-threaded and SIMD parallelism 'for free' without them needing to know about computer architecture or sophisticated C++ libraries for multi-threaded processing. We believe this is an important paradigm setting approach that opens the way for applying similar techniques to other problems that might seem at first remote to vectorisation and/or parallelisation.  © 2022 IEEE.","graph analytics; k-truss decomposition; Numpy; parallel algorithms; Python; SIMD; vectorization","C++ (programming language); Computer architecture; Libraries; Trusses; Graph-analytic; K-truss decomposition; Large graphs; Multi-cores; Multithreaded; Numpy; SIMD; Simple++; Subgraphs; Vectorization; Python","Kabir H., Madduri K., Shared-memory graph truss decomposition, 2017 IEEE 24th International Conference on High Performance Computing (HiPC).

Most of the existing methods are based on the topology of common networks, which ignores the rich information of the nodes in the real network. The k-truss model which is proposed by user engagement and tie strength, captures the degree of strong connection among users who participate in the network with other users actively. However, this model does not consider the attributes of users. In order to find the cohesive subgraphs on social networks efficiently and accurately, this paper proposes a new model (k, r)-truss on the attribute network community based on k-truss, and finds the cohesive subgraphs on the social network from the perspective of strong connection and similarity between users. The problem of enumerating all maximal (k, r)-truss is NP-hard, so in order to speed up the calculation, this paper proposes new pruning algorithms AdvEnumH and AdvEnumHC, which reduces the search space of the mining process significantly. Finally, the experiments are carried out on the real data set to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results of experiments demonstrate that our algorithm has significantly improved in efficiency and timeliness compared with the current best method. © 2019 IEEE.","(k; Attribute Network Community; r)-Truss; Similarity","Common networks; In-network analysis; Mining process; Network communities; Node similarities; Pruning algorithms; Similarity; User engagement; Trusses","Newman M.E.J., Girvan M., Mixing patterns and community structure in networks[J], Statistical Mechanics of Complex Networks, 625, 2, pp. 66-87, (2002); Lim K.H., Datta A., Following the follower: Detecting communities with common interests on twitter[C], ACM Conference on Hypertext and Social Media.

These mathematical entities have a long standing tradition in discrete applied mathematics and computer science. In many cases, they are the most natural means to represent some type of relationships in data. Consequently, a large number of solution methods based on heuristics and exact algorithms exist for problems that have graphs and/or networks as part of their input. While the number of possible applications of these techniques is not limited to problems in business and customer analytics, we have chosen to present some of them in a survey that would allow newcomers to the field of data science to create some familiarity with the key questions that motivate the area. We have also provided a survey on recent applications and new algorithmic approaches for data analytics. In addition we discuss issues related to the computational complexity of some problems associated with them. Other chapters of this section complement the discussion in this chapter with specific examples of interest or that could motivate new novel research direction and application. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Such networks are typically modeled as temporal graphs. Mining cohesive subgraphs from temporal graphs is practical and essential in numerous data mining applications, since mining cohesive subgraphs gets insights into the time-varying nature of temporal graphs. However, existing studies on mining cohesive subgraphs, such as Densest-Exact and k-truss, are mainly tailored for static graphs (whose edges have no temporal information). Therefore, those cohesive subgraph models cannot indicate both the temporal and the structural characteristics of subgraphs. To this end, we explore the model of cohesive temporal subgraphs by incorporating both the evolving and the structural characteristics of temporal subgraphs. Unfortunately, the volume of time intervals in a temporal network is quadratic. As a result, the time complexity of mining temporal cohesive subgraphs is high. To efficiently address the problem, we first mine the temporal density distribution of temporal graphs. Guided by the distribution, we can safely prune many unqualified time intervals with the linear time cost. Then, the remaining time intervals where cohesive temporal subgraphs fall in are examined using the greedy search. The results of the experiments on nine real-world temporal graphs indicate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in efficiency and quality. Specifically, our model only takes less than two minutes on a million-vertex DBLP and has the highest overall average ranking in EDB and TC metrics. © 2022, Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","cohesive subgraph; convex property; temporal feature distribution; temporal network","Data mining; Graph algorithms; Cohesive subgraph; Convex property; Feature distribution; Property; Subgraphs; Temporal feature distribution; Temporal features; Temporal graphs; Temporal networks; Time interval; Graphic methods","Chang L., Qin L., Cohesive subgraph computation over large sparse graphs, Proc. the 35Th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, April, pp. 2068-2071, (2019); Goldberg A.V., Finding a Maximum Density Subgraph, (1984); Rozenshtein P., Gionis A., Mining temporal networks, Proc. the 25Th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, August, pp. 3225-3226, (2019); Lin L., Yuan P., Li R.H., Wang J., Liu L., Jin H., Mining stable quasi-cliques on temporal networks, IEEE Trans.

Mining cohesive components such as k-truss have attracted a lot of effort to improve time efficiency in large-scale graphs. The k-truss is a subgraph where each edge is contained in at least k- 2 triangles and the problem of truss decomposition is computing the k-trusses of a graph for all k. However, most graphs in real scenarios are usually changing over time. The previous studies take the static graphs as input, and the truss maintenance in dynamic graphs receives little attention. This paper focuses on distributed algorithms for truss maintenance. We present a distributed model underlying the real distributed processing model Pregel. Based on the model, we propose truss decomposition and truss maintenance algorithms. To confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments over both real-world and synthetic graphs. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Distributed algorithm; Dynamic graph; Graph analytics; k-truss","Efficiency; Graphic methods; Maintenance; Trusses; Distributed modeling; Distributed processing; Dynamic graph; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Maintenance algorithms; Real-world; Synthetic graphs; Time efficiencies; Graph algorithms","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Cai Z., He Z., Guan X., Li Y., Collective data-sanitization for preventing sensitive information inference attacks in social networks, IEEE Trans.

The k-truss model has been widely used to measure the cohesiveness of subgraphs. Most existing studies about k-truss focus on unsigned graphs. However, in real applications, the edges in the networks can be either positive or negative, e.g., friend or foe relationships, which represents more information than unsigned networks. Therefore, the traditional k-truss model is not applicable for the signed networks. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel model, named signed (k,r)-truss, which leverages the property of balanced triangle in singed network analysis. Specifically, a signed (k,r)-truss is a subgraph where each edge has no less than k balanced support and no more than r unbalanced support. We prove that the problem of identifying the maximum signed (k,r)-truss is NP-hard. Due to the hardness of the problem, we tend to the heuristic strategies. A trivial algorithm is first presented. Then, two greedy algorithms are developed to enhance the processing. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world signed networks to verify the performance of proposed techniques. © 2020 ACM.","balanced theory; k-truss; signed graph; support","Knowledge management; NP-hard; Greedy algorithms; Heuristic strategy; Real applications; Real-world; Signed networks; Subgraphs; Truss model; Unbalanced support; Trusses","Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gionis A., Ordozgoiti B., Ruffo G., Discovering polarized communities in signed networks, CIKM, (2019); Chen Y., Qian T., Liu H., Sun K., Bridge enhanced signed directed network embedding, CIKM, (2018); Chen Z., Yuan L., Lin X., Qin L., Yang J., Efficient maximal balanced clique enumeration in signed networks, WWW, (2020); Giatsidis C., Cautis B., Maniu S., Thilikos D.M., Vazirgiannis M., Quantifying trust dynamics in signed graphs, the s-cores approach, SIAM, (2014); Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Xu Yu J., Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs, SIGMOD, (2014); Leskovec J., Huttenlocher D., Kleinberg J., Signed networks in social media, SIGCHI, (2010); Li R., Dai Q., Qin L., Wang G., Xiao X., Xu Yu J., Qiao S., Efficient signed clique search in signed networks, ICDE, (2018); Sun R., Zhu Q., Chen C., Wang X., Zhang Y., Wang X., Discovering cliques in signed networks based on balance theory, DASFAA, (2020); Tang J., Chang Y., Aggarwal C.C., Liu H., A survey of signed network mining in social media, ACM Comput.

With the development of social network, densest subgraph mining not only need to consider the structural data but also the attributes information, which descripts the features of nodes or edges. However, there are few researches on densest subgraph mining with attribute description. In this article, we only focus on the node-attributed graph. According to the properties of structure and attribute in node-attributed graphs, we define a novel dense subgraph pattern, called hybridized k-truss in attribute-augmented graph. A hybridized k-truss is a subgraph that consists of structural nodes and attribute nodes, of which there are at least (k − 2) common neighbors between any two connected nodes. We introduce the densest hybridized truss problem, and the densest hybridized truss mapping to a densely connected subgraph with homogenous attributes in the original graph. We propose a densest hybridized truss extraction (DHTE) algorithm for node-attributed graphs, to automatically find the densest subgraph with high density and homogenous attributes at the same time. Extensive experimental results of 21 real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DHTE over state-of-the-art methods, through comparison about structural cohesiveness and attributive homogeneity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","attribute description; densest subgraph; hybridized k-truss; Jaccard support; node-attributed graph","Graph algorithms; Trusses; Attributed graphs; Community detection; Connected Subgraph; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Event detection; Real-world datasets; State-of-the-art methods; Subgraph mining; Graph theory","Wuchty S., Almaas E., Peeling the yeast protein network, Proteomics, 5, 2, pp. 444-449, (2005); Bu D., Zhao Y., Cai L., Et al., Topological structure analysis of the protein–protein interaction network in budding yeast, Nucl Acids Res, 31, 9, pp. 2443-2450, (2003); Chapple C.E., Robisson B., Spinelli L., Guien C., Becker E., Brun C., Extreme multifunctional proteins identified from a human protein interaction network, Nat Commun, 6, (2015); Boginski V., Butenko S., Pardalos P.M., On structural properties of the market graph, Innov Financ Econ Netw, 48, pp. 29-35, (2003); Boginski V., Butenko S., Pardalos P.M., Mining market data: a network approach, Comput Oper Res, 33, 11, pp. 3171-3184, (2006); Spirin V., Mirny L.A., Protein complexes and functional modules in molecular networks, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 100, 21, pp. 12123-12128, (2003); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis.

Due to the significant differences of graph typologies, the best performer appearing in the last year's MIT/IEEE/Amazon GraphChallenge presents to manually explore a well-optimized combination from many k-Truss techniques for each graph dataset, but this requires expertise from multiple disciplines. Linear algebra provides a unified framework to write parallel and scalable k-Truss decomposition algorithm easily. However, the work imbalance and low memory efficiency remain. In this work, we propose a productive yet efficient k-Truss decomposition implementation on GPU based on the fine-grained linear algebra. We propose a preprocessing method that renumbers the vertices to eliminate the longest adjacency list to balance the workloads and putting the adjacency list of the same source vertex into shared memory that exploits the shared memory effectively to improve memory access efficiency.

Existing k-truss models are defined solely in pairwise graphs and are hence unsuitable for hypergraphs. In this paper, we propose a novel problem, named (k, α, β) -truss computation in hypergraphs. We then propose two hypergraph conversions. The first converts a hypergraph into a pairwise graph, while the second converts it into a projected graph. We further propose two algorithms for computing (k, α, β) -truss in hypergraphs based on these two types of conversions. Experiments show that our (k, α, β) -truss model is effective and our algorithms are efficient in large hypergraphs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cohesive subgraph; Hypergraph; Truss computation","Graph algorithms; Biological networks; Cohesive subgraph; Cooperation networks; Hyper graph; Network cooperation; Subgraph mining; Subgraphs; Truss computation; Truss model; Trusses","Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An o(m) algorithm for cores decomposition of networks, Comput.

Finding the largest k-truss in a graph is an important problem in graph analysis. The truss decomposition algorithm is widely used in finding k-truss because of its simplicity and ease of implementation. With the explosive growth of graph data scale, the traditional truss decomposition algorithm causes a lot of redundant computation and is no longer applicable. The kmax search strategy that combines large, medium and small steps, realizes subgraph prediction through k-core, reduces the data size, uses large, medium and small steps to retrieve, reduces the number of iterations, and eliminates some redundant calculations. However, the middle step and small step use fixed values, and the number of iterations is too many on some scale graphs. This paper proposes a dynamic adaptive step size method, and uses the clique to analyze the intermediate results, ending the iterative process early and improving the execution efficiency. The experimental results show that compared with the existing kmax search strategy combining large, medium and small steps, 30% iterations can be reduced. © 2022 SPIE.

In this study, we take Chinese text as the research object and propose a multi-feature fusion keyword extraction algorithm combined with BERT semantics and K-Truss graph(BSKT). The BSKT algorithm is based on the TextRank algorithm, which combines BERT semantic features, K-Truss features, and other features. First, the BSKT algorithm obtains the word vectors from the BERT pretraining model to calculate the semantic difference, which is used to optimize the iterative process of the TextRank word graph. Then, the BSKT algorithm obtains its K-Truss graph by decomposing the TextRank word graph and obtains the truss level feature of the word. Finally, by combining the word IDF and truss level features, the BSKT algorithm scores the words to extract keywords. Experimental results show that the BSKT algorithm achieves better performance than the latest keyword extraction algorithm SCTR in the task of extracting 1-10 keywords. Furthermore, the increment in F1 increased by 11.2% when the BSKT algorithm was used to extract three keywords from the Sensor dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.","BERT word vector; K-Truss graph; Keyword extraction; semantics; TextRank","Bit error rate; Data mining; Extraction; Feature extraction; Iterative methods; Job analysis; Trusses; BERT word vector; Bit-error rate; Extraction algorithms; Features extraction; Graph algorithms; K-truss graph; Keywords extraction; Task analysis; Textrank; Word vectors; Semantics","Luhn H.P., The automatic creation of literature abstracts, IBM J.

As both the user engagement of nodes and the strength of relationships are important, the (k,s)-core model is proposed in the literature to discover strong communities. Nevertheless, the decomposition algorithm regarding (k,s)-core is not yet investigated. In this paper, we propose (k,s)-core algorithms to decompose a graph into its hierarchical structures considering both user engagement and tie strength. We first present the basic (k,s)-core decomposition methods. Then, we propose the advanced algorithms DES and DEK which index the support of edges to enable higher-level cost-sharing in the peeling process. In addition, effective pruning strategies are applied to DES/DEK to further enhance performance. Moreover, we build a novel index based on the decomposition result and investigate an efficient (k,s)-core query algorithm based on our index. Extensive experimental evaluations on 12 real-world datasets verify the efficiency of our proposed decomposition algorithms and show that our index-based query algorithm can speed up the state-of-the-art query algorithms by up to three orders of magnitude. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Cohesive subgraph; Graph decomposition; Index; Query","Cost effectiveness; Database systems; Query processing; Decomposition algorithm; Decomposition methods; Experimental evaluation; Graph decompositions; Hierarchical decompositions; Hierarchical structures; Real-world datasets; Three orders of magnitude; Graph algorithms","Altaf-Ul-Amine M., Et al., Prediction of protein functions based on k-cores of protein-protein interaction networks and amino acid sequences, Genome Inform, 14, pp. 498-499, (2003); Alvarez-Hamelin J.I., Dall'Asta L., Barrat A., Vespignani A., Large scale networks fingerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 41-50, (2006); Chang L., Yu J.X., Qin L., Lin X., Liu C., Liang W., Efficiently computing k-edge connected components via graph decomposition, SIGMOD, pp. 205-216, (2013); Cohen J., Trusses: cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, (2019); Dorogovtsev S.N., Goltsev A.V., Mendes J.F.F., K-core organization of complex networks, Phys.

The notion of k-truss is widely used in graph analytics. Since graphs are continuously evolving in real applications and it is costly to compute trusses from scratch, we study the problem of truss maintenance which aims at designing efficient incremental algorithms to update trusses when graphs are updated with changes. An incremental algorithm is desired to be bounded; that is, its cost is of O(f (kCHANGEDkc )) for some polynomial function f and some positive integer c, where CHANGED comprises the changes to both the graph and the result and kCHANGEDkc is the size of the c-hop neighborhood of CHANGED. An incremental problem is bounded if it has a bounded incremental algorithm and is unbounded otherwise. Under the model of locally persistent algorithms, we prove that truss maintenance is bounded under edge removals but is unbounded even for unit edge insertions. To address the unboundedness, we formulate a new notion AFF which, as a practically effective alternative to CHANGED, represents a set of edges affected by the changes to the graph, and devise an insertion algorithm that is bounded with respect to AFF, while retaining the boundedness for edge removals. More specifically, our insertion algorithm runs in O(f (kAFF kc )) time for some polynomial function f and some positive integer c with kAFF kc being the size of the c-hop neighborhood of AFF. Our extensive performance studies show that our new algorithms can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art by up to 3 orders of magnitude for the 12 large real graphs tested and are more efficient than computing trusses from scratch even for changes of non-trivial size. We report our findings in this paper. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Boundedness; Incremental Computation; K-Truss","Functions; Graphic methods; Industrial research; Maintenance; Boundedness; Incremental algorithm; Incremental computation; Insertion algorithms; Orders of magnitude; Performance study; Polynomial functions; Real applications; Trusses","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Alpern B., Hoover R., Rosen B.K., Sweeney P.F., Kenneth Zadeck F., Incremental evaluation of computational circuits, Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 32-42, (1990); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An O(M) Algorithm for Cores Decomposition of Networks, (2003); Bender M.A., Cole R., Demaine E.D., Farach-Colton M., Zito J., Two simplified algorithms for maintaining order in a list, European Symposium on Algorithms, pp. 152-164, (2002); Berman A.M., Lower and Upper Bounds for Incremental Algorithms, (1992); Chen P.-L., Chou C.-K., Chen M.-S., Distributed algorithms for k-truss decomposition, IEEE International Conference on Big Data, pp. 471-480, (2014); Cheng J., Ke Y., Chu S., Tamer Ozsu M., Efficient core decomposition in massive networks, IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 51-62, (2011); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, 16, (2008); Colomer-De Simon P., Angeles Serrano M., Beiro M.G., Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin J., Boguna M., Deciphering the global organization of clustering in real complex networks, Scientific Reports, 3, (2013); Dietz P., Sleator D., Two algorithms for maintaining order in a list, Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 365-372, (1987); Fan W., Hu C., Tian C., Incremental graph computations: Doable and undoable, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 155-169, (2017); Fan W., Wang X., Wu Y., Incremental graph pattern matching, ACM Transactions on Database Systems, 38, 3, (2013); Fan W., Xu J., Wu Y., Yu W., Jiang J., Zheng Z., Zhang B., Cao Y., Tian C., Parallelizing sequential graph computations, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 495-510, (2017); Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1311-1322, (2014); Kabir H., Madduri K., Parallel k-truss decomposition on multicore systems, IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference, pp. 1-7, (2017); Orsini C., Gregori E., Lenzini L., Krioukov D., Evolution of the Internet k-dense structure, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 22, 6, pp. 1769-1780, (2014); Ramalingam G., Reps T., On the computational complexity of dynamic graph problems, Theoretical Computer Science, 158, 1, pp. 233-277, (1996); Sariyuce A.E., Gedik B., Jacques-Silva G., Wu K.-L., Catalyurek U.V., Incremental k-core decomposition: Algorithms and evaluation, The VLDB Journal, 25, 3, pp. 425-447, (2016); Sariyuce A.E., Pinar A., Fast hierarchy construction for dense subgraphs, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 10, 3, pp. 97-108, (2016); Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Local algorithms for hierarchical dense subgraph discovery, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 12, 1, pp. 43-56, (2018); Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Catalyurek U.V., Finding the hierarchy of dense subgraphs using nucleus decompositions, Proceedings of the International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 927-937, (2015); Smith S., Liu X., Ahmed N.K., Tom A.S., Petrini F., Karypis G., Truss decomposition on shared-memory parallel systems, IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference, pp. 1-6, (2017); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Wen D., Qin L., Zhang Y., Lin X., Yu J.X., I/o efficient core graph decomposition at web scale, IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 133-144, (2016); Zhang F., Yuan L., Zhang Y., Qin L., Lin X., Zhou A., Discovering strong communities with user engagement and tie strength, International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, pp. 425-441, (2018); Zhang Y., Parthasarathy S., Extracting analyzing and visualizing triangle k-core motifs within networks, IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 1049-1060, (2012); Zhang Y., Yu J.X., Zhang Y., Qin L., A fast order-based approach for core maintenance, IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering, pp. 337-348, (2017); Zhou R., Liu C., Yu J.X., Liang W., Zhang Y., Efficient Truss Maintenance in Evolving Networks, (2014)","","","Association for Computing Machinery","07308078","978-145035643-5","","","English","Proc.

Our k-truss algorithm is implemented using HavoqGT, an asynchronous vertex-centric graph analytics framework for distributed memory. We present a brief experimental evaluation on two large, real-world, scale-free graphs: a 128B edge web-graph and a 1.4B edge twitter follower graph.

Although different methods have been proposed to extract k-truss subgraphs, they are unable to deal with big graphs, and they suffer from the lack of efficiency. To deal with the problem of finding k-truss subgraphs in big graphs, we propose a novel efficient distributed algorithm, called KTMiner, based on the MapReduce paradigm and the key–value structure. KTMiner is deployed on the Spark platform, a big data framework. Given a specific k value, KTMiner finds edges belonging to the k-truss subgraphs. It includes three consequent phases. First, a novel distributed k-core routine is employed to prune unnecessary vertices from the input graph. Then, the triangle information per edge in the form of a new data structure, called Triangle Set (TSet), is produced. Finally, using a distributed iterative procedure, the desired k-truss subgraphs are detected. KTMiner perfectly caches the reusable data in the distributed memory. In addition, it forms an efficient load balancing mechanism by designing appropriate data structures. This results in a fine-grained parallelism. The superiority of our solution over the state-of-the-art methods is shown by the experiments on real-world graphs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Big graphs; Cohesive subgraphs; Distributed algorithm; K-core; K-truss; Triangle counting","Data structures; Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Parallel algorithms; Big graphs; Distributed Memory; Fine-grained parallelism; K-cores; Load-balancing mechanisms; State-of-the-art methods; Subgraphs; Triangle counting; Trusses","Rossi M.-E.G., Malliaros F.D., Vazirgiannis M., Spread it good spread it fast: Identification of influential nodes in social networks, pp. 101-102, (2015); Dourisboure Y., Geraci F., Pellegrini M., Extraction and classification of dense communities in the web, pp. 461-470, (2007); Palla G., Farkas I., Derenyi I., Vicsek T., Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in nature and society, Nature, 435, pp. 814-818, (2005); Luce R.D., Perry A.D., A method of matrix analysis of group structure, Psychometrika., 14, pp. 95-116, (1949); Alba R.D., A graph-theoretic definition of a sociometric clique, J.

Most earlier works aim to retrieve communities relevant to the query nodes QU and query keywords QW , and some recent works begin to focus on keyword-based attributed community search (KACS) with only query keywords QW , aiming to return a structural cohesive community with the highest score relevant to QW. However, these scores only consider the semantic similarity between user attributes and QW and neglect the semantic similarity between users in the community. Thus, we propose a new community model which considers both semantic similarities and uses triangle-connected k-truss to ensure structural cohesiveness, and study the top-r keyword-based attributed community search (rKACS) problem for a given QW to provide more candidates for users to choose the preferred communities. To find the top-r communities, we first propose the Basic algorithm, which gradually finds the communities with large scores through maximal clique enumerations. Then, we further propose an improved algorithm Incremental based on two novel optimization techniques, which can significantly reduce the search space and find the maximal cliques incrementally. Extensive experimental studies on four real-world datasets validated the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.  © 2023 IEEE.","community search, keyword search, attributed graph","Search engines; Attributed graphs; Community model; Community search, keyword search, attributed graph; Keyword search; Keyword-based; Maximal clique enumerations; Query nodes; Search keyword; Search problem; Semantic similarity; Semantics","Sozio M., Gionis A., The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party, Proceedings of the 16th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, pp. 939-948, (2010); Chen K.-T., Lei C.-L., Network game design: Hints and implications of player interaction, Proceedings of 5th ACM SIGCOMM Workshop on Network and System Support for Games.

Given one or more query nodes, this problem aims to discover densely connected subgroups containing these nodes. Various algorithms have been proposed to solve this challenging problem using different measures or a variety of cohesive subgraphs. In this paper, given an undirected graph and a set of query nodes, we study the community search using novel several cohesive subgraph models. More precisely, we propose to exploit several cohesive structures in a unified framework to find densely communities for query nodes in large complex networks. First, we review some existing cohesive structures. Next, to make these structures more effective models of communities, we focus on interesting configurations that are larger and more cohesive by fulfilling some constraints. The new structures obtained allow to ensure a larger density on the discovered communities and overcome some weaknesses of existing models. Finally, empirical results show the effectiveness of our framework to find communities for query nodes in a variety of real graphs.  © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

The existing algorithms for computing k-truss of today's massive networks mainly focus on reducing the runtime using parallel computation on a powerful multi-core server. Our focus, by contrast, is to investigate the feasibility of computing the k-truss on a single consumer-grade machine within a reasonable amount of time. We engineer two efficient k-truss decomposition algorithms: The edge-peeling algorithm proposed by J. Wang and J. Cheng and the asynchronous h-index-updating algorithm proposed by A. E. Sariyuce, C. Seshadhri, and A. Pinar. We reduce their memory usage significantly by optimizing the underlying data structures and by using WebGraph, an efficient framework for graph compression. With our optimized implementation, we show that we can efficiently compute k-truss decomposition of large networks (e.g., a graph with 1.2 billion edges) on a single consumer-grade machine. © 2018 IEEE.","graph analytics; k-core; k-truss","Computer networks; Information systems; Decomposition algorithm; Graph analytics; Graph compressions; Hierarchical structures; K-cores; Multi-core servers; Optimized implementation; Parallel Computation; Trusses","Zhao G., Yuan J., Discovering thematic patterns in videos via cohesive sub-graph mining, IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 1260-1265, (2011); Shao Y., Chen L., Cui B., Efficient cohesive subgraphs detection in parallel, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 613-624, (2014); Wang N., Parthasarathy S., Tan K.L., Tung A.K., Csv: Visualizing and mining cohesive subgraphs, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 445-458, (2008); Moser F., Colak R., Rafiey A., Ester M., Mining cohesive patterns from graphs with feature vectors, Proceedings of the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining, pp. 593-604, (2009); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, 16, (2008); Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying k-truss community in large and dynamic graphs, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 1311-1322, (2014); Chen P.L., Chou C.K., Chen M.S., Distributed algorithms for k-truss decomposition, IEEE International Conference on Big Data, 2014, pp. 471-480, (2014); Huang X., Lu W., Lakshmanan L.V., Truss decomposition of probabilistic graphs: Semantics and algorithms, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 77-90, (2016); Katunka A.M., Yan C., Serge K.B., Zhang Z., K-Truss Based Top-Communities Search in Large Graphs, International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big Data, pp. 244-249, (2017); Bron C., Kerbosch J., Algorithm 457: Finding all cliques of an undirected graph, Communications of the ACM, 16, 9, pp. 575-577, (1973); Zhao F., Tung A.K., Large scale cohesive subgraphs discovery for social network visual analysis, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2012, 6, 2, pp. 85-96; Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2005, 9, 4, pp. 276-287; Verma A., Buchanan A., Butenko S., Solving the maximum clique and vertex coloring problems on very large sparse networks, TextitINFORMS Journal on Computing, 27, 1, pp. 164-177, (2015); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Khaouid W., Barsky M., Srinivasan V., Thomo A., K-core decomposition of large networks on a single PC, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 9, 1, pp. 13-23, (2015); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An O (M) Algorithm for Cores Decomposition of Networks, (2003); Hu X., Liu F., Srinivasan V., Thomo A., K-core Decomposition on Giraph and GraphChi, International Conference on Intelligent Networking and Collaborative Systems, pp. 274-284, (2017); Tootoonchi B., Srinivasan V., Thomo A., Efficient implementation of anchored 2-core algorithm, Proceedings of the IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining, pp. 1009-1016, (2017); Zhang H., Zhao H., Cai W., Zhao M., Luo G., Visualization and cognition of large-scale software structure using the k-core analysis, IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, pp. 954-957, (2008); Kabir H., Madduri K., Shared-memory Graph Truss Decomposition, (2017); Smith S., Liu X., Ahmed N.K., Tom A.S., Petrini F., Karypis G., Truss decomposition on shared-memory parallel systems, IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference, (2017); Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Parallel Local Algorithms for Core, Truss, and Nucleus Decompositions, (2017); Voegele C., Lu Y.S., Pai S., Pingali K., Parallel triangle counting and k-truss identification using graph-centric methods, IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference, (2017); Boldi P., Vigna S., The webgraph framework I: Compression techniques, Proceedings of the ACM International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 595-602, (2004); Dasari N.S., Desh R., Zubair M., ParK: An efficient algorithm for k-core decomposition on multicore processors, IEEE International Conference on Big Data, 2014, pp. 9-16, (2014)","J.

As is known, when the size of graph grows, for achieving better performance, it is natural for a service provider to outsource the services to a powerful cloud. However, this stresses the need for privacy-preserving <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$k$</tex-math></inline-formula>-truss community query services, as the cloud server is not fully trustable.

Core decomposition and truss decomposition address this problem from two different perspectives. The former is a vertex-driven approach that assigns density indicators for vertices whereas the latter is an edge-driven technique that put density quantifiers on edges. Despite the algorithmic similarity between these two approaches, it is not clear how core and truss decompositions in a network are related. In this work, we introduce the vertex interplay (VI) and edge interplay (EI) plots to characterize the interplay between core and truss decompositions. Based on our observations, we devise Core-TrussDD, an anomaly detection algorithm to identify the discrepancies between core and truss decompositions. We analyze a large and diverse set of real-world networks, and demonstrate how our approaches can be effective tools to characterize the patterns and anomalies in the networks. Through VI and EI plots, we observe distinct behaviors for graphs from different domains, and identify two anomalous behaviors driven by specific real-world structures. Our algorithm provides an efficient solution to retrieve the outliers in the networks, which correspond to the two anomalous behaviors. We believe that investigating the interplay between core and truss decompositions is important and can yield surprising insights regarding the dense subgraph structure of real-world networks. © 2020 IEEE.","dense subgraph discovery; k-core decomposition; k-truss decomposition","Anomaly detection; Big data; Anomalous behavior; Anomaly-detection algorithms; Dense region; Dense subgraph; Different domains; Effective tool; In-network analysis; Real-world networks; Trusses","Du X., Jin R., Ding L., Lee V.E., Migration motif: A spatial -Temporal pattern mining approach for financial markets, Kdd, pp. 1135-1144, (2009); Gibson D., Kumar R., Tomkins A., Discovering large dense subgraphs in massive graphs, Vldb, pp. 721-732, (2005); Fratkin E., Naughton B.T., Brutlag D.L., Batzoglou S., Motifcut: Regulatory motifs finding with maximum density subgraphs, Ismb, pp. 156-157, (2006); Seidman S.B., Network structure and minimum degree, Social Networks, 5, 3, pp. 269-287, (1983); Saito K., Yamada T., Extracting communities from complex networks by the k-dense method, Icdmw, (2006); Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Atalyurek U., Finding the hierarchy of dense subgraphs using nucleus decompositions, Www, pp. 927-937, (2015); Sariyuce A.E., Seshadhri C., Pinar A., Atalyurek U., Nucleus decompositions for identifying hierarchy of dense subgraphs, Acm Transactions on the Web (TWEB), 11, 3, (2017); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An O(m) Algorithm for Cores Decomposition of Networks, (2003); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive Subgraphs for Social Network Analysis, (2008); Seshadhri C., Kolda T.G., Pinar A., Community structure and scale-free collections of erdos-renyi graphs, Phys.

The truss decomposition assigns each edge the maximum k for which the edge belongs to a k-truss, and the trussness of a graph is the maximum among its edges. Discovery algorithms for k-trusses and truss decomposition provide useful insight for graph analytics (such as community detection). Even though they take polynomial time, on massive networks they suffer from handling a potentially cubic number of wedges: algorithms either need a long time to recompute triangles several times, have high memory usage, or rely on the large number of cores on graphic units. In this paper we describe EXTRUSS, a highly optimized algorithm for truss decomposition which outperforms existing algorithms. We then introduce a faster algorithm, HYBTRUSS, which finds the trussness of a graph using less time and space than EXTRUSS. Our algorithms take the best of existing approaches having good performance, low memory usage, and no need for sophisticated hardware systems.

Hash-based algorithms for triangle counting fail to take advantage of available vectorization in modern processors. Linear algebraic-based methods often involve sparse matrix multiplication which is inherently expensive. Nonlinear algebraic methods have a slow implementation and count each triangle multiple times which is then rescaled to obtain the exact triangle count. We propose a fast vector instruction implementation of a set operation-based triangle counting algorithm, which avoids matrix multiplication and finds the exact triangle count directly. Our implementation outperforms reference implementations proposed by the MIT graph challenge and miniTri when tried on about 40 graphs from the SNAP large network dataset, giving a speedup ranging from 41× to more than 1500×. A comparison against existing state-of-the-art techniques gave a speedup of 3× on average. We additionally show that this algorithm can easily be plugged into graph frameworks that either use or can be modified to use compressed sparse row like representation, to give faster compute times. We also propose an optimization to the k truss decomposition algorithm that can be used with the optimized triangle counting algorithm to give better performance. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Exact triangle counting; Graphs; Set operations; SIMD; SNAP; Vector instructions","","Samsi S., Gadepally V., Hurley M., Jones M., Kao E., Mohindra S., Monticciolo P., Reuther A., Smith S., Song W., Static graph challenge: subgraph isomorphism, 2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-6, (2017); Kuo C.-Y., Hang C.N., Yu P.-D., Tan C.W., Parallel counting of triangles in large graphs: pruning and hierarchical clustering algorithms, 2018 IEEE High Performance extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-6, (2018); Bunch J.R., Hopcroft J.E., Triangular factorization and inversion by fast matrix multiplication, Math.

In this work, we propose two algorithms to mine key scholars based on collapsed k-core/k-truss and closeness centrality. The proposed algorithms mine key scholars mainly from two perspectives, i.e., component segmentation calculation and auxiliary decision metric. The proposed algorithms are irrelevant to network connectivity, which performs with high efficiency. We employ closeness centrality to avoid the derivation of greedy strategy. By comparing with other baseline methods, we find that the two proposed algorithms outperform with higher efficiency and better effectiveness. © 2019 IEEE.","Closeness centrality; Collapsed k-core; Collapsed k-truss; Key scholars; Network component","Big data; Efficiency; Network components; Baseline methods; Closeness centralities; Co-authorship networks; Greedy strategies; Higher efficiency; K-cores; Key scholars; Network connectivity; Trusses","Kong X., Shi Y., Yu S., Liu J., Xia F., Academic social networks: Modeling, analysis, mining and applications, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, (2019); Yu S., Liu J., Yang Z., Chen Z., Jiang H., Tolba A., Xia F., Pave: Personalized academic venue recommendation exploiting co-publication networks, Journal of Network and Computer Applications, 104, pp. 38-47, (2018); Yoon S., Goltsev A., Mendes J., Structural stability of interaction networks against negative external fields, Physical Review e, 97, 4, (2018); Morone F., Del Ferraro G., Makse H.A., The k-core as a predictor of structural collapse in mutualistic ecosystems, Nature Physics, 15, 1, (2019); Benson A.R., Gleich D.F., Leskovec J., Higher-order organization of complex networks, Science, 353, 6295, pp. 163-166, (2016); Zhang F., Li C., Zhang Y., Qin L., Zhang W., Finding critical users in social communities: The collapsed core and truss problems, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, (2018)","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-172813024-8","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The k-truss is one of the most commonly studied cohesive subgraphs, in which each edge is formed in at least k-2 triangles. A critical issue in mining a k-truss lies in the computation of the trussness of each edge, which is the maximum value of k that an edge can be in a k-truss. Existing works mostly focus on truss computation in static graphs by sequential models. However, the graphs are constantly changing dynamically in the real world. We study distributed truss computation in dynamic graphs in this paper. In particular, we compute the trussness of edges based on the local nature of the k-truss in a synchronized node-centric distributed model. Iteratively decomposing the trussness of edges by relying only on local topological information is possible with the proposed distributed decomposition algorithm. Moreover, the distributed maintenance algorithm only needs to update a small amount of dynamic information to complete the computation. Extensive experiments have been conducted to show the scalability and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.  © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press.","cohesive subgraph; distributed algorithm; dynamic graph; graph mining; k-truss","Graphic methods; Iterative methods; Cohesive subgraph; Critical issues; Dynamic graph; Graph analysis; Graph mining; K-truss; Large-scales; Real-world; Sequential modeling; Subgraphs; Trusses","Luo Q., Yu D., Cai Z., Lin X., Cheng X., Hypercore maintenance in dynamic hypergraphs, Proc. 37th Ieee Int.

Recent studies show that machine learning (ML)-based community search can return higher-quality communities than the classic methods such as k-core and k-truss. However, the state-of-the-art ML-based models require a large number of labeled data (i.e., nodes in ground-truth communities) for training that are difficult to obtain in real applications, and incur unaffordable memory costs or query time for large datasets. To address these issues, in this paper, we present the community search based on contrastive learning with partition, namely COCLEP, which only requires a few labels and is both memory and query efficient. In particular, given a small collection of query nodes and a few (e.g., three) corresponding ground-truth community nodes for each query, COCLEP learns a query-dependent model through the proposed graph neural network and the designed label-aware contrastive learner. The former perceives query node information, low-order neighborhood information, and high-order hypergraph structure information, the latter contrasts low-order intra-view, high-order intra-view, and low-high-order inter-view representations of the nodes. Further, we theoretically prove that COCLEP can be scalable to large datasets with the min-cut over the graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adopt contrastive learning for community search task that is nontrivial. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that COCLEP simultaneously achieves better community effectiveness and comparably high query efficiency while using fewer labels compared with the-state-of-the-art approaches and is scalable for large datasets.  © 2023 IEEE.","","Graph algorithms; Graph neural networks; Graph processing; Ground truth; High quality; High-order; Higher-order; Large datasets; Low order; Machine-learning; Query nodes; Semi-supervised; Large dataset","Fang Y., Huang X., Qin L., Zhang Y., Zhang W., Cheng R., Lin X., A survey of community search over big graphs, The VLDB Journal, 29, 1, pp. 353-392, (2020); Chen L., Liu C., Liao K., Li J., Zhou R., Contextual community search over large social networks, ICDE, pp. 88-99, (2019); Sozio M., Gionis A., The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party, SIGKDD, pp. 939-948, (2010); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, Proc.

What are the common patterns and the anomalies? How can we exploit them for applications? A k-core is the maximal subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least k. This concept has been applied to such diverse areas as hierarchical structure analysis, graph visualization, and graph clustering. Here, we explore pervasive patterns related to k-cores and emerging in graphs from diverse domains. Our discoveries are: (1) Mirror Pattern: coreness (i.e., maximum k such that each vertex belongs to the k-core) is strongly correlated with degree. (2) Core-Triangle Pattern: degeneracy (i.e., maximum k such that the k-core exists) obeys a 3-to-1 power-law with respect to the count of triangles. (3) Structured Core Pattern: degeneracy–cores are not cliques but have non-trivial structures such as core–periphery and communities. Our algorithmic contributions show the usefulness of these patterns. (1) Core-A, which measures the deviation from Mirror Pattern, successfully spots anomalies in real-world graphs, (2) Core-D, a single-pass streaming algorithm based on Core-Triangle Pattern, accurately estimates degeneracy up to 12× faster than its competitor.

Second, VizCS offers a user-friendly visual interface to formulate queries and a real-Time response query processing engine. Last but not least, VizCS generates a community exploration wall by offering interactive community visualization, which facilitates users to in-depth understanding of the data.

It is widely used for community detection applications such as social networks and security analysis, and the performance of truss analytics highly depends on its triangle counting method. This paper proposes a novel triangle counting kernel named Minimum Search (MS). Minimum Search can select two smaller adjacency lists out of three and uses fine-grained parallelism to improve the performance of triangle counting. Then, two basic algorithms, MS-based triangle counting, and MS-based support updating are developed. Based on the novel triangle counting kernel and the two basic algorithms above, three fundamental parallel truss analytics algorithms are designed and implemented to enable different kinds of graph truss analysis. These truss algorithms include an optimized K-Truss algorithm, a Max-Truss algorithm, and a Truss Decomposition algorithm. Moreover, all proposed algorithms have been implemented in the parallel language Chapel and integrated into an open-source framework, Arkouda. Through Arkouda, data scientists can efficiently con-duct graph analysis through an easy-to-use Python interface and handle large-scale graph data in powerful back-end computing resources. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can significantly improve the performance of truss analysis on real-world graphs compared with the existing and widely adopted list intersection-based method.

We focus on the computation of dense hierarchies and regions with graph nuclei - -a generalization of k-cores and trusses. Static computation of nuclei, namely through variants of 'peeling', are easy to understand and implement. However, many practically important graphs undergo continuous change. Dynamic algorithms, maintaining nucleus computations on dynamic graph streams, are nuanced and require significant effort to port between nuclei, e.g., from k-cores to trusses. We propose a unifying framework to maintain nuclei in dynamic graph streams. First, we show no dynamic algorithm can asymptotically beat re-computation, highlighting the need to experimentally understand variability. Next, we prove equivalence between k-cores on a special hypergraph and nuclei. Our algorithm splits the problem into maintaining the special hypergraph and maintaining k-cores on it. We implement our algorithm and experimentally demonstrate improvements up to 108 x over re-computation. We show algorithmic improvements on k-cores apply to trusses and outperform truss-specific implementations. © 2021 ACM.","dynamic algorithms; k-core; k-truss; nucleus decomposition","Graph algorithms; Information retrieval; Trusses; Websites; Dense region; Dense sub-graphs; Dynamic algorithm; Dynamic graph; Graph mining; Hypergraph; K-cores; ON dynamics; Data mining","Google Programming Contest, (2002); Alpern B., Hoover R., Rosen B.K., Sweeney P.F., Kenneth Zadeck F., Incremental evaluation of computational circuits, Proceedings of the First Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 32-42, (1990); Ignacio-Alvarez-Hamelin J., Dall'Asta L., Barrat A., Vespignani A., Large scale networks fingerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 41-50, (2006); Angel A., Sarkas N., Koudas N., Srivastava D., Dense subgraph maintenance under streaming edge weight updates for real-time story identification, Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 5, 6, pp. 574-585, (2012); Brandes U., Kenis P., Lerner J., Raaij D.V., Network analysis of collaboration structure in wikipedia, Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 731-740, (2009); Brunato M., Hoos H.H., Battiti R., On effectively finding maximal quasi-cliques in graphs, International Conference on Learning and Intelligent Optimization, pp. 41-55, (2007); Cho E., Myers S.A., Leskovec J., Friendship and mobility: User movement in location-based social networks, Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 1082-1090, (2011); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, (2008); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Lu Y., Wang W., Online search of overlapping communities, Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, pp. 277-288, (2013); Das A., Svendsen M., Tirthapura S., Incremental maintenance of maximal cliques in a dynamic graph, The VLDB Journal, 28, 3, pp. 351-375, (2019); Dourisboure Y., Geraci F., Pellegrini M., Extraction and classification of dense communities in the web, Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on World Wide Web, pp. 461-470, (2007); Eidsaa M., Almaas E., S-core network decomposition: A generalization of κ-core analysis to weighted networks, Phys.

However, many studies often fail to take into account the social relationships among users, and close social relationships usually guarantee the consistency of users’ preferences. Many real-world applications, such as community-based product recommendation services, require such queries. In this paper, we propose a new problem: the k-truss community most favorites querying problem based on user top-t favorites. Specifically, both the k-truss community and the corresponding most favorite object are retrieved. We first present the baseline solution to the problem. The main idea is to find the same object in the top-t favorites of the users in the social network and build the k-truss community for these users with the same preferences. Furthermore, we propose a reverse query algorithm to speed up the processing of the k − t CMF querying problem by filtering users in the social network. The experiment results on both real and synthetic datasets significantly demonstrate that the proposed solutions are efficient and scalable. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","K-truss community; Query processing; Top-t","Query processing; Social aspects; Community-based; K-truss community; Problem-based; Product recommendation; Query algorithms; Real-world; Social relationships; Speed up; Top-t; User's preferences; Trusses","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, International Conference on Very Large Data Bases, (2017); Borzsony S., Kossmann D., Stocker K., The skyline operator, International Conference on Data Engineering, (2002); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, Natl.

These graphs may include social networks, computer networks, and genomes. In this paper, we propose a novel graph package Arachne to make large-scale graph analytics more effortless and more efficient based on the open-source Arkouda framework, which has been developed to allow users to perform massively parallel computations on distributed data with an interface similar to NumPy. In this package, we developed a fundamental sparse graph data structure and several useful graph algorithms around our data structure to build a basic algorithmic library.

Recently, a useful problem of dense subgraph maximization has attracted significant attentions, which aims at enlarging a dense subgraph pattern using a few new edge insertions, e.g., k-core maximization. As a more cohesive subgraph of k-core, k-truss requires that each edge has at least k-2 triangles within this subgraph. However, the problem of k-truss maximization has not been studied yet. In this paper, we motivate and formulate a new problem of budget-constrained k-truss maximization. Given a budget of b edges and an integer k≥2, the problem is to find and insert b new edges into a graph G such that the resulted k-truss of G is maximized. We theoretically prove the NP-hardness of k-truss maximization problem. To efficiently tackle it, we analyze non-submodular property of k-truss newcomers function and develop non-conventional heuristic strategies for edge insertions. We first identify high-quality candidate edges with regard to (k-1)-light subgraphs and propose a greedy algorithm using per-edge insertion. Besides further improving the efficiency by pruning disqualified candidate edges, we finally develop a component-based dynamic programming algorithm for enlarging k-truss mostly, which makes a balance of budget assignment and inserts multiple edges simultaneously into all (k-1)-light components. Extensive experiments on nine real-world graphs demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed methods. © 2021 ACM.","edge insertions; k-truss; subgraph maximization","Budget control; Dynamic programming; Efficiency; Component based approach; Dense sub-graphs; Edge insertion; Graph G; Graph-analytic; K-cores; K-truss; Large graphs; Subgraph maximization; Subgraphs; Trusses","Agarwal V., Bharadwaj K.K., Trust-enhanced recommendation of friends in web based social networks using genetic algorithms to learn user preferences, International Conference on Computational Science, Engineering and Information Technology, pp. 476-485, (2011); Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin J., Dall'Asta L., Barrat A., Vespig-Nani A., Large scale networks fngerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 41-50, (2006); Bhawalkar K., Kleinberg J., Lewi K., Roughgarden T., Sharma A., Preventing unraveling in social networks: The anchored k-core problem, Siam Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 29, 3, pp. 1452-1475, (2015); Che Y., Lai Z., Sun S., Wang Y., Luo Q., Accelerating truss decomposition on heterogeneous processors, Proceedings of the Vldb Endowment, 13, 10, pp. 1751-1764, (2020); Chen P., Chou C., Chen M., Distributed algorithms for k-truss decomposition.

However, most existing methods only consider simple, undirected, unweighted networks. Complex networks in the real-world often have rich information though: edges are asymmetrical and nodes/edges have categorical and numerical attributes. Finding dense subgraphs in such networks in accordance with this rich information is an important problem with many applications. Furthermore, most existing algorithms ignore the higher-order relationships (i.e., motifs) among the nodes. Motifs are shown to be helpful for dense subgraph discovery but their wide spectrum in heterogeneous networks makes it challenging to utilize them effectively. In this work, we propose quark decomposition framework to locate dense subgraphs that are rich with a given motif. We focus on networks with directed edges and categorical attributes on nodes/edges. For a given motif, our framework builds subgraphs, called quarks, in varying quality and with hierarchical relations. Our framework is versatile, efficient, and extendible. We discuss the limitations and practical instantiations of our framework as well as the role confusion problem that needs to be considered in directed networks. We give an extensive evaluation of our framework in directed, signed-directed, and node-labeled networks. We consider various motifs and evaluate the quark decomposition using several real-world networks. Results show that quark decomposition performs better than the state-of-the-art techniques. Our framework is also practical and scalable to networks with up to 101M edges.

A k-truss is an inclusion-maximal subgraph Hin which each edge belongs to at least k-2triangles inside H. The truss decomposition establishes, for each edge e, the maximum kfor which ebelongs to a k-truss. Analogously to the largest clique and to the maximum k-core, the strongest community for k-truss is the max-truss, which corresponds to the k-truss having the maximum k. Even though the computation of truss decomposition and of the max-truss takes polynomial time, on a large scale, it suffers from handling a potentially cubic number of wedges. In this paper, we provide a new algorithm FMT, which advances the state of the art on different sides: lower execution time, lower memory usage, and no need for expensive hardware. We compare FMT experimentally with the most recent state-of-the-art algorithms on a set of large real-world and synthetic networks with over a billion edges. The massive improvement allows FMT to compute the max-truss of networks of tens of billions of edges on a single standard server machine. © 2013 IEEE.","Community detection; graph algorithms; in-memory computation; k-trusses; social network analysis; truss decomposition","Graph algorithms; Polynomial approximation; Population dynamics; Community detection; Expensive hardware; Induced subgraphs; Minimum degree; Polynomial-time; Server machines; State of the art; Synthetic networks; Trusses","Nash-Williams C.S.J.A., Edge-disjoint spanning trees of finite graphs, J.

However, most existing works on influence diffusion focus on static networks. In this paper, we study the problem of maximizing influence diffusion in dynamic social networks, i.e. networks that change over time. We propose the following algorithms under the Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade (IC) models: (a) the DM algorithm which is an extension of MATI algorithm and solves the Influence Maximization (IM) problem in dynamic networks, (b) the DM-C algorithm which is a latter version of DM and solves the IM problem using k-core decomposition and the core number information, (c) the DM-T algorithm which is another version of DM, that uses K-truss decomposition and the truss number information in order to solve the IM problem. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms increase diffusion performance by 2 times compared with several state of the art algorithms and achieve comparable results in diffusion with the Greedy algorithm. Also, the proposed algorithms are 8.5 times faster in computational time compared with previous methods. © 2022","Diffusion; Dynamic social networks; Graphs; Maximization influence; Social influence","Economic and social effects; Trusses; Dynamic social networks; Graph; Influence maximizations; Maximization influence; Maximization problem; Networks and graphs; Number information; Social graphs; Social influence; Static networks; Diffusion","Borgs C., Brautbar M., Chayes J., Lucier B., Maximizing social influence in nearly optimal time, SODA, pp. 946-957, (2014); Cai T., Li J., Mian A., Li R.-H., Sellis T., Yu J.X., Target-Aware holistic influence maximization in spatial social networks, IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering, 34, pp. 1993-2007, (2022); Chen S., Wang C., Wang Y., Scalable influence maximization for prevalent viral marketing in large-scale social networks,  ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining -KDD 2010, pp. 1029-1038, (2010); Chen S., Wang Y., Yang Y., Efficient influence maximization in social networks,  ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining -KDD 2009, pp. 199-207, (2009); Goyal A., Lu W., Lakshmanan V.S., SIMPATH: an efficient algorithm for influence maximization under the linear Threshold model, ICDM, (2011); Habiba C.T., Berger-Wolf T.Y., Maximizing the extent of spread in a dynamic network, (2007); Jakkula V.R., Karypis G., Streaming and batch Algorithms for truss decomposition, 2019 first international conference on graph computing (GC), pp. 51-59, (2019); Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network, KDD, pp. 137-146, (2003); Li G., Chen S., Feng J., Tan K.-L., Li W.-S., Efficient location-aware influence maximization, SIGMOD, pp. 87-98, (2014); Li H., Bhowmick S.S., Sun A., Cui J., Conformity-aware influence maximization in online social networks, VLDB J, 24, 1, pp. 117-141, (2015); Li Y., Zhang D., Tan K.-L., Real-time targeted influence maximization for online advertisements, PVLDB, 8, 10, pp. 1070-1081, (2015); Murata T., Koga H., Extended methods for influence maximization in dynamic networks, Comput Soc Netw, 5, (2018); Nguyen H.T., Thai M.T., Dinh T.N., Stop-and-stare: optimal sampling algorithms for viral marketing in billion-scale networks, SIGMOD, pp. 695-710, (2016); Osawa S., Murata T., Selecting seed nodes for influence maximization in dynamic networks, Proceedings of the 6th workshop on complex networks (CompleNet 2015), studies in computational intelligence, pp. 91-98, (2015); Li R.-H., Jeffrey Xu Y., Mao R., Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs, IEEE transactions on knowledge and data engineering, 26, pp. 2453-2465, (2014); Rossi M., Shi B., Tziortziotis N., Malliaros F., Giatsidis C., Vazirgiannis M., MATI: an efficient algorithm for influence maximization in social networks, PLoS One, (2018); Smani G.I., Megalooikonomou V., Influence maximization in dynamic social networks and graphs, ICSNAM 2022: 16, International conference on social network analysis and mining june 02-03, (2022); Song X., Li J., Lei Q., Zhao W., Chen Y., Mian A., (2022); Tang Y., Shi Y., Xiao X., Influence maximization in near-linear time: a martingale approach, SIGMOD, pp. 1539-1554, (2015); Tang Y., Xiao X., Shi Y., Influence maximization: near-optimal time complexity meets practical efficiency, SIGMOD, pp. 75-86, (2014); Wang X., Zhang Y., Zhang W., Lin X., Distance-aware influence maximization in geo-social network, ICDE, pp. 1-12, (2016); Xue G., Zhong M., Li J., Chen C., Kong R., Dynamic network embedding survey, Neurocomputing, 472, pp. 213-223, (2022)","G.I.

To provide a solution that benefits from existing studies on community detection, we decouple the spatial constraint from graph structural constraint and propose a uniform CCD framework which gives users the freedom to choose customized measurements for social cohesiveness (e.g., k-core or k-Truss). For the spatial closeness constraint, we apply the bounded radius spatial constraint and develop an exact algorithm together with effective pruning rules. To further improve the efficiency and make our framework scale to a very large scale of data, we propose a near-linear time approximation algorithm with a constant approximation ratio (2). We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms. © Proceedings of the 3rd ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Analytics for Local Events and News, LENS 2019.

A k-truss (k≥ 2 ) is a subgraph that each edge is in at least k- 2 triangles. The existing algorithm is to first compute the number of triangles for each edge, and then iteratively increase k to peel off the edges that are not in the (k+ 1 )-truss. Due to the scale of the data and the intensity of computations, truss decomposition algorithm on the billion-side graph may take more than hours on a commodity server. In addition, today, more servers adopt NUMA architecture, which also affects the scalability of the algorithm. Therefore, we propose a NUMA-aware shared-memory parallel algorithm to accelerate the truss decomposition for NUMA systems by (1) computing different levels of k-truss between each NUMA nodes (2) dividing the range of k heuristically to ensure load balance (3) optimizing data structure and triangle counting method to reduce remote memory access, data contention and data skew. Our experiments show that on real-world datasets our OpenMP implementation can accelerate truss decomposition effectively on NUMA systems. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Graph analysis; Multithread; NUMA; Triangle counting; Truss decomposition","Application programming interfaces (API); Iterative methods; Memory architecture; Decomposition algorithm; Graph analysis; Large-scales; Multi-thread; NUMA; NUMA systems; Number of triangles; Subgraphs; Triangle counting; Truss decomposition; Trusses","Akbas E., Peixiang Z., Truss-based community search: A truss-equivalence based indexing approach, Proc.

This work describes and evaluates new software algorithm optimizations undertaken for our 2018 year submission on Collaborative CPU+GPU Algorithms for Triangle Counting and Truss Decomposition. First, we describe four major optimizations for the triangle counting which improved performance by up to 117x over our prior submission. Additionally, we show that our triangle-counting algorithm is on average 151.7x faster than NVIDIA's NVGraph library (max 476x) for SNAP datasets. Second, we propose a novel parallel k-truss decomposition algorithm that is time-efficient and is up to 13.9x faster than our previous submission. Third, we evaluate the effect of generational hardware improvements between the IBM 'Minsky' (POWER8, P100, NVLink 1.0) and 'Newell' (POWER9, V100, NVLink 2.0) platforms. Lastly, the software optimizations presented in this work and the hardware improvements in the Newell platform enable analytics and discovery on large graphs with millions of nodes and billions of edges in less than a minute. In sum, the new algorithmic implementations are significantly faster and can handle much larger 'big' graphs. © 2018 IEEE.","Collaborative graph algorithms; CUDA; GPU; Triangle counting; Truss decomposition","Graphics processing unit; CUDA; Decomposition algorithm; GPU algorithms; Graph algorithms; Software algorithms; Software optimization; Time-efficient; Triangle counting; Trusses","Samsi S., Gadepally V., Hurley M., Jones M., Kao E., Mohindra S., Monticciolo P., Reuther A., Smith S., Song W., Staheli D., Kepner J., Static graph challenge: Subgraph isomorphism, IEEE HPEC, (2017); Date K., Feng K., Nagi R., Xiong J., Kim N.S., Hwu W.M., Collaborative (cpu + GPU) algorithms for triangle counting and truss decomposition on the minsky architecture: Static graph challenge: Subgraph isomorphism, 2017 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), pp. 1-7, (2017); NVIDIA NVGraph Api Reference Documentation, (2018); Latapy M., Main-memory triangle computations for very large (sparse (power-law)) graphs, Theoretical Computer Science, 407, 1, pp. 458-473, (2008); Caldeira A.B., Haug V., Vetter S., IBM power system 822lc for high performance computing introduction and technical overview, IBM Redbooks, (2016); Caldeira A.B., IBM Power System AC922 Introduction and Technical Overview, (2018); NVIDIA Tesla P100.

K-truss decomposition is an algorithm for identifying the most influential nodes in the network. We find that K-truss decomposition only considers edge clustering characteristics, without considering the diffusion characteristics, so it is easily affected by the local clustering structure in the network, such as core-like groups. There are mutually closely connected the core-like groups in the network, but the correlation between the core-like groups and the other parts of the network is less, so the information is easy to spread in the core-like groups, but not in the other parts of the network, nor over the whole network. For the reason, we propose an index to measure the edge diffusion characteristics in a network, and it is found that the diffusion characteristics of some edges in the periphery of the network are relatively high, but the clustering characteristics of these edges are relatively low, so they are not beneficial for rapid information propagation. In this paper, by considering the relationship between the clustering characteristics and diffusion characteristics of the edges, we propose a novel network structure optimization algorithm for information propagation. By measuring the comprehensive ability strength of the clustering characteristics and the diffusion characteristics of the edges, we can filter out the edges whose comprehensive ability is poor in the network, then determine whether the edges should be optimized according to the relative relationship between the clustering characteristics and the diffusion characteristics of the edges. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is carried out to optimize the structures of four real networks, and verify the effective range of information propagation before and after the optimization of network structure from the classical independent cascade model. The results show that the network topology optimized by the proposed algorithm can effectively increase the range of information propagation. Moreover, the number of leaf nodes in the optimized network is reduced, and the clustering coefficient and the average path length are also reduced. © 2018 Chinese Physical Society.","Clustering characteristics of edges; Diffusion characteristics of edges; Information propagation; Optimization of network structure","Complex networks; Diffusion; Information dissemination; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Trusses; Average path length; Clustering characteristics of edges; Clustering coefficient; Diffusion characteristics; Influential nodes; Information propagation; Network structures; Optimization of network; Clustering algorithms","Barabasi A.L., Albert R., Science, 286, (1999); Watts D.J., Strogatz S.H., Nature, 393, (1998); Pastor-Satorras R., Vespignani A., Phys.

This is a relaxation of the clique. It has proved to be a useful tool in identifying cohesive subnetworks in a variety of real-world graphs. Despite its simplicity and its utility, the combinatorial and algorithmic aspects of trusses have not been thoroughly explored. We provide nearly-tight bounds on the edge counts of k-trusses. We also give two improved algorithms for finding trusses in large-scale graphs. First, we present a simplified and faster algorithm, based on approach discussed in Wang & Cheng (2012).

For many graph based problems it is necessary to find intersections for a very large number of lists-these lists tend to vary greatly in size and are difficult to efficiently load-balance. Numerous parallel algorithms on list intersections for triangle counting have been proposed, but load-balancing decisions are typically made at a global level. In this paper we present an efficient and adaptive approach to load-balancing at a finer granularity. Our approach assigns a different number of threads for different intersections in order to effectively utilize the resources of the GPU. We show the applicability of our load-balancing method to two different intersection methods, one search-based and one merge-based. Our algorithm outperforms several recent triangle counting algorithms, including recent HPEC Graph Challenge Champions. © 2018 IEEE.","","Graphic methods; Adaptive approach; Graph-based; Intersection method; Load balance; Load balancing methods; Maximal k; Number of threads; Search-based; Graphics processing unit","Futuresystems: Digital Science Center, School of Informatics and Computing, Indiana University; Becchetti L., Boldi P., Castillo C., Gionis A., Efficient semistreaming algorithms for local triangle counting in massive graphs, 14th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf. on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 16-24, (2008); Bisson M., Fatica M., High performance exact triangle counting on GPUs, IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems, 28, 12, pp. 3501-3510, (2017); Bisson M., Fatica M., Static graph challenge on GPU, High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC), 2017 IEEE.

The k-truss of a graph can also represent an important community in the graph. Finding the k-truss of a graph can be done in a polynomial amount of time, in contrast finding other subgraphs such as cliques. While there are numerous formulations and algorithms for finding the maximal k-truss of a graph, many of these tend to be computationally expensive and do not scale well. Many algorithms are iterative and use static graph triangle counting in each iteration of the graph. In this work we present a novel algorithm for finding both the k-truss of the graph (for a given k), as well as the maximal k-truss using a dynamic graph formulation. Our algorithm has two main benefits. 1) Unlike many algorithms that rerun the static graph triangle counting after the removal of non-conforming edges, we use a new dynamic graph formulation that only requires updating the edges affected by the removal. As our updates are local, we only do a fraction of the work compared to the other algorithms. 2) Our algorithm is extremely scalable and is able to concurrently detect deleted triangles in contrast to past sequential approaches. While our algorithm is architecture independent, we show a CUDA based implementation for NVIDIA GPUs. In numerous instances, our new algorithm is anywhere from 100X-10000X faster than the Graph Challenge benchmark. Furthermore, our algorithm shows significant speedups, in some cases over 70X, over a recently developed sequential and highly optimized algorithm. © 2017 IEEE.","","Program processors; Trusses; Dynamic graph; IS architecture; Maximal k; Novel algorithm; Optimized algorithms; Sequential approach; Subgraphs; Iterative methods","Becchetti L., Boldi P., Castillo C., Gionis A., Efficient semistreaming algorithms for local triangle counting in massive graphs, 14th ACM SIGKDD Int'l Conf.

However, most previous community models only consider the link structure and ignore the link weights of the community, which may miss some useful properties of the community. In this paper, we propose a novel community model, called weighted k-truss community, based on the concept of k-truss. The proposed model takes the edge weight into consideration, thus can better characterize the properties of a community. Based on the new community model, we design a BFS-based online search algorithm to find the top-r weighted k-truss communities in O(m1.5) time, where m denotes the number of edges in a network. To speed up the online search algorithm, we devise a space-efficient index structure, namely KEP-Index, to support efficient community search. We propose two algorithms to construct the index structure in an offline manner. Based on KEP-Index, the time complexity for finding the top-r weighted k-truss communities is linear to the size of these communities, thus it is optimal. We conduct extensive experiments on six large real-world networks, as well as a case study over a co-authorship network. The results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed community model and algorithms. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Community search; Weighted k-truss community; Weighted networks","Learning algorithms; Online searching; Trusses; Co-authorship networks; Community search; Real-world networks; Search Algorithms; Social network minings; Useful properties; Weighted k-truss community; Weighted networks; Complex networks","Newman M.E., The structure and function of complex networks, SIAM Rev., 45, 2, pp. 167-256, (2003); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Wang W., Local search of communities in large graphs, SIGMOD, pp. 991-1002, (2014); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, Data Min.

Due to the two different data formats, the information contained in the graph is replicated, thereby incurring both time and space for the replication. Using K-truss as an example, we demonstrate that an edge-centric K-truss algorithm, the Eager K-truss algorithm, can be identified from a linear algebraic formulation using only the adjacency matrix. In addition, we demonstrate that our implementation of the linear algebraic edge-centric K-truss algorithm out-performs a Galois' K-truss implementation by an average (over 53 graphs) of more than 13 times, and up to 71 times. © 2018 IEEE.","Edge-centric Algorithms; Graph Algorithms; High Performance; K-truss; Linear Algebra","Linear algebra; Trusses; Adjacency matrices; Graph algorithms; High Performance; Linear-algebraic; Matrix algebra","Malewicz G., Austern M.H., Bik A.J., Dehnert J.C., Horn I., Leiser N., Czajkowski G., Pregel: A system for large-scale graph processing, Proceedings of the 2010 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data.

In recent years, some researchers have considered keyword information to make the attributed community search is gradually emerging, which is widely used in social network marketing and setting up of social events. However, some problems require that the query communities cannot contain certain forbidden nodes, which has not received any attention in previous work. Based on this, this paper proposes undirected attributed community search with forbidden nodes problem (FATQ), which not only avoids forbidden nodes from existing in the query communities, but also guarantees the structure cohesiveness of the query communities and the keyword cohesiveness of the communities. Finally, this paper proposes two different search algorithms for FATQ problem and evaluates our algorithms on multiple datasets. The results show that correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Attributed graphs; Community search; K-truss; Social circle discovery","Computer science; Control engineering; Engineering; Industrial engineering; Attributed graphs; Community search; Multiple data sets; Network marketing; Search Algorithms; Search problem; Social circles; Social events; Computers","Girvan M., Newman M.E.J., Community structure in social and biological networks [J], Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, (2002); Shen H.W., Cheng X.Q., Cai K., Et al., Detect overlapping and hierarchical community structure in networks [J], Physica A-Statistical Mechanics and Its Applications, (2009); Newman M.E.J., Community Detection in Networks: Modularity Optimization and Maximum Likelihood Are Equivalent [J], (2016); Raghavan U.N., Albert R., Kumara S., Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks, Physical Review e, (2007); Xie J., Szymanski B.K., Liu X., Slpa: Uncovering overlapping communities in social networks via a speaker-listener interaction dynamic process, Proc. of the 11th ICDMW.

In this paper, we study online communitysearch for query-dependent communities, which is a different but practically useful task. Given a query vertex in a graph, the problem is to find meaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a community model based on the k-truss concept, which brings nice structural and computational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supports the efficient search of k-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the community size. We also investigate the k-truss community search problem in a dynamic graph setting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges. In addition, to support k-truss community search over massive graphs which cannot entirely fit in main memory, we propose I/O-efficient algorithms for query processing under the semi-external model. Extensive experiments on massive real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our k-truss community model, the efficiency, and the scalability of our in-memory and semi-external community search algorithms. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","community search; dynamic graphs; k-truss; semi-external algorithms","Graph algorithms; Graph theory; Trusses; Community detection; Community model; Computational properties; External community; Index structure; Insertions and deletions; Real-world networks; Search Algorithms; Graph structures","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: a truss-equivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Boldi P., Vigna S., The WebGraph framework I: Compression techniques, WWW, pp. 595-601, (2004); Chang L., Lin X., Qin L., Yu J.X., Zhang W., Index-based optimal algorithms for computing steiner components with maximum connectivity, SIGMOD, pp. 459-474, (2015); Chiba N., Nishizeki T., Arboricity and subgraph listing algorithms, SIAM J.

The truss decomposition algorithm calculates the number of triangles formed by each edge, then peels off the edges with the number of triangles less than k-2 iteratively. The incremental maxk-truss algorithm must detect k-truss one by one making it inefficient. We propose a two-stage maxk-ktruss decomposition algorithm PSKT. The innovation points of PSKT are as follows: 1) The k-core structure is used to predict the maxk value, and the structure helps us avoid unnecessary mass calculations. 2) The characteristic that the k-truss of graph G must be included in the (k-l)-core of graph G is utilized to ensure that the proposed algorithm can safely prune in the graph. 3) A suitable triangle counting algorithm and the dynamic stream compression method are used to improve the algorithm efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PSKT is 15.26 times faster than the incremental algorithm FMT-dec and 3 times faster than the state-of-the-art maxk-truss algorithm FMT-max. © 2023 IEEE.","k-core; k-truss; triangle counting; truss decomposition","Graph theory; Trusses; Decomposition algorithm; Graph G; K-cores; K-truss; Large-scales; Number of triangles; Subgraphs; Triangle counting; Truss decomposition; Two-stage algorithm; Iterative methods","Luce R.D., Perry A.D., A method of matrix analysis of group structure, Psychometrika, 14, 2, pp. 95-116, (1949); Luce R.D., Connectivity and generalized cliques in sociometric group structure, Psychometrika, 15, 2, pp. 169-190, (1950); Seidman S.B., Foster B.L., A graph-theoretic generalization of the clique concept, Journal of Mathematical sociology, 6, 1, pp. 139-154, (1978); Seidman S.B., Network structure and minimum degree, Social networks, 5, 3, pp. 269-287, (1983); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National security agency technical report, 16, 31, (2008); Kong Y.-X., Shi G.-Y., Wu R.-J., Zhang Y.-C., k-core: Theories and applications, Physics Reports, 832, pp. 1-32, (2019); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, (2012); Mailthody V.S., Date K., Qureshi Z., Pearson C., Nagi R., Xiong J., Hwu W.-M., Collaborative (cpu+gpu) algorithms for triangle counting and truss decomposition, 2018 IEEE High Performance extreme Computing Conference (HPEC).

The model of k-Truss not only captures actively engaged users, but also ensures strong tie strength among these users. It motivates us to utilize the model of k-Truss in preventing network unraveling, which simultaneously considers both of the basic components. In this paper, we propose and investigate the anchored k-Truss problem to reinforce a network by anchoring critical users who can significantly stop the unraveling. We prove the problem is NP-hard for k ≥ 4. A fast edge deletion order based algorithm, named AKT, is proposed with efficient candidate exploration and pruning techniques based on the order. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-life graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and the efficiency of our methods. © 2018 IEEE.","K-Truss; social network; Tie strength; user engagement","Engineering; Industrial engineering; Social networking (online); NP-hard; Pruning techniques; Tie strengths; User engagement; Trusses","Akbas E., Zhao P., Truss-based community search: A trussequivalence based indexing approach, PVLDB, 10, 11, pp. 1298-1309, (2017); Aral S., Walker D., Tie strength, embeddedness, and social influence: A large-scale networked experiment, Management Science, 60, 6, pp. 1352-1370, (2014); Bakshy E., Rosenn I., Marlow C., Adamic L.A., The Role of Social Networks in Information Diffusion, WWW, pp. 519-528, (2012); Bhawalkar K., Kleinberg J., Lewi K., Roughgarden T., Sharma A., Preventing unraveling in social networks: The anchored k-core problem, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 29, 3, pp. 1452-1475, (2015); Chitnis R.H., Fomin F.V., Golovach P.A., Preventing unraveling in social networks gets harder, AAAI, (2013); Cohen Trusses J., Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, (2008); Eagle N., Pentland A.S., Lazer D., Inferring friendship network structure by using mobile phone data, PNAS, 106, 36, pp. 15274-15278, (2009); Garcia D., Mavrodiev P., Schweitzer F., Social resilience in online communities: The autopsy of friendster, COSN, pp. 39-50, (2013); Gilbert E., Karahalios K., Predicting tie strength with social media, SIGCHI, pp. 211-220, (2009); Grabowicz P.A., Ramasco J.J., Moro E., Pujol J.M., Eguiluz V.M., Social features of online networks: The strength of weak ties in online social media, CoRR, (2011); Granovetter M.S., The strength of weak ties, American Journal of Sociology, 78, 6, pp. 1360-1380, (1973); Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying k-Truss community in large and dynamic graphs, SIGMOD, pp. 1311-1322, (2014); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Attribute-driven community search, PVLDB, 10, 9, pp. 949-960, (2017); Huang X., Lu W., Lakshmanan S.L., Truss decomposition of probabilistic graphs: Semantics and algorithms, SIGMOD, pp. 77-90, (2016); Karp R.M., Reducibility among combinatorial problems, Complexity of Computer Computations, pp. 85-103, (1972); Luce R.D., Perry A.D., A method of matrix analysis of group structure, Psychometrika, 14, 2, pp. 95-116, (1949); Malliaros F.D., Vazirgiannis M., To stay or not to stay: Modeling engagement dynamics in social graphs, CIKM, pp. 469-478, (2013); Meladianos P., Nikolentzos G., Rousseau F., Stavrakas Y., Vazirgiannis M., Degeneracy-based real-Time sub-event detection in twitter stream, ICWSM, pp. 248-257, (2015); Rotabi R., Kamath K., Kleinberg J.M., Sharma A., Detecting strong ties using network motifs, WWW, pp. 983-992, (2017); Seidman S.B., Network structure and minimum degree, Social Networks, 5, 3, pp. 269-287, (1983); Seidman S.B., Foster B.L., A graph-Theoretic generalization of the clique concept, Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 6, 1, pp. 139-154, (1978); Seki K., Nakamura M., The collapse of the friendster network started from the center of the core, ASONAM, pp. 477-484, (2016); Shao Y., Chen L., Cui B., Efficient cohesive subgraphs detection in parallel, SIGMOD, pp. 613-624, (2014); Sintos S., Tsaparas P., Using strong triadic closure to characterize ties in social networks, SIGKDD, pp. 1466-1475, (2014); Takaguchi T., Yoshida Y., Cycle and flow trusses in directed networks, Royal Society Open Science, 3, 11, (2016); Ugander J., Backstrom L., Marlow C., Kleinberg J., Structural diversity in social contagion, PNAS, 109, 16, pp. 5962-5966, (2012); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, PVLDB, 5, 9, pp. 812-823, (2012); Wang X., Donaldson R., Nell C., Gorniak P., Ester M., Bu J., Recommending groups to users using user-group engagement and timedependent matrix factorization, AAAI, (2016); Wu S., Sarma A.D., Fabrikant A., Lattanzi S., Tomkins A., Arrival and departure dynamics in social networks, WSDM, pp. 233-242, (2013); Zhang F., Zhang W., Zhang Y., Qin L., Lin X., OLAK: An efficient algorithm to prevent unraveling in social networks, PVLDB, 10, 6, pp. 649-660, (2017); Zhang F., Zhang Y., Qin L., Zhang W., Lin X., Finding critical users for social network engagement: The collapsed k-core problem, AAAI, pp. 245-251, (2017); Zhang F., Zhang Y., Qin L., Zhang W., Lin X., When engagement meets similarity: Efficient (k, r)-core computation on social networks, PVLDB, 10, 10, pp. 998-1009, (2017); Zhao F., Tung H.A.K., Tung.

A popular model to measure social network engagement is kk-core, the maximal subgraph in which every vertex has at least kk neighbors. To identify critical users, we propose the collapsed kk-core problem: given a graph GG, a positive integer kk and a budget bb, we aim to find bb vertices in GG such that the deletion of the bb vertices leads to the smallest kk-core. We prove the problem is NP-hard and inapproximate. An efficient algorithm is proposed, which significantly reduces the number of candidate vertices. We also study the user leave towards the model of kk-truss which further considers tie strength by conducting additional computation w.r.t. kk-core. We prove the corresponding collapsed kk-truss problem is also NP-hard and inapproximate. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The advantages and disadvantages of the two proposed models are experimentally compared. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-life social networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed methods. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","Cohesive subgraph; k-core; k-truss; tie strength; user engagement","Budget control; Fans; Heuristic algorithms; Proteins; Trusses; Complexity theory; Computational model; K-cores; Prediction algorithms; Social network services; Subgraphs; Tie strengths; User engagement; Graph theory","Malliaros F.D., Vazirgiannis M., To stay or not to stay: Modeling engagement dynamics in social graphs, Proc. 22nd ACM Int.

This notion has attracted much attention, because it models meaningful cohesive subgraphs of a graph. We introduce the problem of identifying a smallest edge subset of a given graph whose removal makes the graph k-truss-free. We also introduce a problem variant where the identified subset contains only edges incident to a given set of nodes and ensures that these nodes are not contained in any k-truss. These problems are directly applicable in communication networks: the identified edges correspond to vital network connections; or in social networks: the identified edges can be hidden by users or sanitized from the output graph. We show that these problems are NP-hard. We thus develop exact exponential-time algorithms to solve them. To process large networks, we also develop heuristics sped up by an efficient data structure for updating the truss decomposition under edge deletions. We complement our heuristics with a lower bound on the size of an optimal solution to rigorously evaluate their effectiveness. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world graphs show that our heuristics are effective (close to the optimal or to the lower bound) and also efficient (up to two orders of magnitude faster than a natural baseline). © 2021 Owner/Author.","community detection; graph algorithm; k-truss","NP-hard; Optimization; Trusses; Efficient data structures; Exact exponential-time algorithms; Large networks; Lower bounds; Network connection; Optimal solutions; Orders of magnitude; Real-world graphs; Data mining","Alon N., Yuster R., Zwick U., Finding and counting given length cycles, Algorithmica, 17, 3, pp. 209-223, (1997); Aravind N.R., Sandeep R.B., Sivadasan N., Dichotomy results on the hardness of h-free edge modification problems, SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 31, 1, pp. 542-561, (2017); Beigi G., Liu H., A survey on privacy in social media: Identification, mitigation, and applications, ACM/IMS Trans.

In applications such as analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, citation graphs, and collaboration networks, nodes tend to have attributes. Unfortunately, most previous community search algorithms ignore attributes and result in communities with poor cohesion w.r.t. their node attributes. In this paper, we study the problem of attribute-driven community search, that is, given an undirected graph G where nodes are associated with attributes, and an input query Q consisting of nodes Vq and attributes Wq, find the communities containing Vq, in which most community members are densely inter-connected and have similar attributes. We formulate this problem as finding attributed truss communities (ATC), i.e., finding connected and close k-truss subgraphs containing Vq, with the largest attribute relevance score. We design a framework of desirable properties that good score function should satisfy. We show that the problem is NP-hard. However, we develop an efficient greedy algorithmic framework to iteratively remove nodes with the least popular attributes, and shrink the graph into an ATC. In addition, we also build an elegant index to maintain k-truss structure and attribute information, and propose efficient query processing algorithms. Extensive experiments on large real-world networks with ground-truth communities show that our algorithms significantly outperform the state of the art and demonstrates their efficiency and effectiveness. © 2017 VLDB Endowment.","","Iterative methods; Proteins; Query languages; Trusses; Algorithmic framework; Attribute information; Collaboration network; Protein-protein interaction networks; Query processing algorithms; Real-world networks; Search Algorithms; Undirected graph; State of the art; Graph theory","Agrawal S., Chaudhuri S., Das G., Dbxplorer: A system for keyword-based search over relational databases, ICDE, pp. 5-16, (2002); Bahmani B., Kumar R., Vassilvitskii S., Densest subgraph in streaming and mapreduce, PVLDB, 5, 5, pp. 454-465, (2012); Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and effective community search, DMKD, 29, 5, pp. 1406-1433, (2015); Bhalotia G., Hulgeri A., Nakhe C., Chakrabarti S., Sudarshan S., Keyword searching and browsing in databases using banks, ICDE, pp. 431-440, (2002); Bothorel C., Cruz J.D., Magnani M., Micenkova B., Clustering attributed graphs: models, measures and methods, Network Science, 3, 3, pp. 408-444, (2015); Cheng H., Zhou Y., Huang X., Yu J.X., Clustering large attributed information networks: an efficient incremental computing approach, DMKD, 25, 3, pp. 450-477, (2012); Chiba N., Nishizeki T., Arboricity and subgraph listing algorithms, SIAM J.

However, most existing studies do not address the ""free rider"" issue, that is, nodes far away from query nodes and irrelevant to them are included in the detected community. Some state-of-the-art models have attempted to address this issue, but not only are their formulated problems NP-hard, they do not admit any approximations without restrictive assumptions, which may not always hold in practice. In this paper, given an undirected graph G and a set of query nodes Q, we study community search using the k-truss based community model. We formulate our problem of finding a closest truss community (CTC), as finding a connected k-truss subgraph with the largest k that contains Q, and has the minimum diameter among such subgraphs. We prove this problem is NP-hard. Furthermore, it is NP-hard to approximate the problem within a factor (2 - ε), for any ε > 0. However, we develop a greedy algorithmic framework, which first finds a CTC containing Q, and then iteratively removes the furthest nodes from Q, from the graph. The method achieves 2- approximation to the optimal solution. To further improve the efficiency, we make use of a compact truss index and develop efficient algorithms for k-truss identification and maintenance as nodes get eliminated. In addition, using bulk deletion optimization and local exploration strategies, we propose two more efficient algorithms. One of them trades some approximation quality for efficiency while the other is a very efficient heuristic. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world networks show the effectiveness and efficiency of our community model and search algorithms. © 2015 VLDB Endowment 21508097/15/12.","","Algorithms; Efficiency; Graph theory; Information services; Iterative methods; Trusses; Algorithmic framework; Approximation quality; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Exploration strategies; Formulated problems; Information networks; Real-world networks; Search Algorithms; Optimization","Ahn Y.-Y., Bagrow J.P., Lehmann S., Link communities reveal multiscale complexity in networks., Nature, 466, 7307, pp. 761-764, (2010); Batagelj V., Zaversnik M., An o (m) algorithm for cores decomposition of networks.; Bron C., Kerbosch J., Finding all cliques of an undirected graph (algorithm 457)., Commun.

However, the existing parallel solutions to identify the k-truss are inefficient for very large graphs, as they still suffer from huge communication cost and large number of iterations during the computation. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel and efficient truss detection algorithm, called PETA. The PETA produces a triangle complete subgraph (TC-subgraph) for every computing node. Based on the TC-subgraphs, PETA can detect the local k-truss in parallel within a few iterations. We theoretically prove, within this new paradigm, the communication cost of PETA is bounded by three times of the number of triangles, the total computation complexity of PETA is the same order as the best known serial algorithm and the number of iterations for a given partition scheme is minimized as well. Furthermore, we present a subgraph-oriented model to efficiently express PETA in parallel graph computing systems. The results of comprehensive experiments demonstrate, compared with the existing solutions, PETA saves 2X to 19X in communication cost, reduces 80% to 95% number of iterations and improves the overall performance by 80% across various real-world graphs.","Cohesive subgraph; Graph algorithm; Subgraph-oriented; Truss","Communication; Costs; Computation complexity; Detection algorithm; Graph algorithms; Number of iterations; Number of triangles; Parallel solutions; Subgraph-oriented; Subgraphs; Trusses","Giraph; Afrati F.N., Fotakis D., Ullman D.J., Enumerating subgraph instances using map-reduce, ICDE, (2013); Alba R.D., A graph-theoretic definition of a sociometric clique, J.

It is of crucial importance to identify which entities act as influential spreaders that can propagate information to a large portion of the network, in order to ensure efficient information diffusion, optimize available resources or even control the spreading. In this work, we capitalize on the properties of the K-truss decomposition, a triangle-based extension of the core decomposition of graphs, to locate individual influential nodes. Our analysis on real networks indicates that the nodes belonging to the maximal K-truss subgraph show better spreading behavior compared to previously used importance criteria, including node degree and k-core index, leading to faster and wider epidemic spreading. We further show that nodes belonging to such dense subgraphs, dominate the small set of nodes that achieve the optimal spreading in the network.","","Algorithms; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer); algorithm; artificial neural network; theoretical model","Michael T., Randolph E.B., Koen P., Effects of word-of-mouth versus traditional marketing: Findings from an internet social networking site, Journal of Marketing, 73, 5, pp. 90-102, (2009); Domingos P., Richardson M., Mining the network value of customers, KDD '01: Proceedings of the Seventh ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 57-66, (2001); Mark E.J.N., The structure and function of complex networks, SIAM Review, 45, 2, pp. 167-256, (2003); Reka A., Albert-Laszlo B., Statistical mechanics of complex networks, Rev.

A k-truss is a dense subgraph definition that can be considered a relaxation of a clique. Truss decomposition refers to a partitioning of all the edges in the graph based on their k-truss membership. The truss decomposition of a graph has many applications. We show that our new approach PKT consistently outperforms other truss decomposition approaches for a collection of large sparse graphs and on a 24-core shared-memory server.

Yet most standard formulations of this problem (like clique, quasiclique, k-densest subgraph) are NP-hard. Furthermore, the goal is rarely to find the ""true optimum"", but to identify many (if not all) dense substructures, understand their distribution in the graph, and ideally determine relationships among them. Current dense subgraph finding algorithms usually optimize some objective, and only find a few such subgraphs without providing any structural relations. We define the nucleus decomposition of a graph, which represents the graph as a forest of nuclei. Each nucleus is a subgraph where smaller cliques are present in many larger cliques. The forest of nuclei is a hierarchy by containment, where the edge density increases as we proceed towards leaf nuclei. Sibling nuclei can have limited intersections, which enables discovering overlapping dense subgraphs. With the right parameters, the nucleus decomposition generalizes the classic notions of k-cores and k-Truss decompositions. We give provably efficient algorithms for nucleus decompositions, and empirically evaluate their behavior in a variety of real graphs. The tree of nuclei consistently gives a global, hierarchical snapshot of dense substructures, and outputs dense subgraphs of higher quality than other stateof-the-Art solutions. Our algorithm can process graphs with tens of millions of edges in less than an hour.","Dense subgraph discovery; Density hierarchy; Graph decomposition; K-core; K-Truss; Overlapping dense subgraphs","Algorithms; Bioinformatics; Forestry; Optimization; Trusses; Dense sub-graphs; Dense subgraph; Edge densities; Finding algorithm; Graph decompositions; K-cores; Process graphs; State of the art; World Wide Web","University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection; Alvarez-Hamelin J.I., Barrat A., Vespignani A., Large scale networks fingerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, pp. 41-50, (2006); Andersen R., Chellapilla K., Finding dense subgraphs with size bounds, Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-Graph (WAW, pp. 25-37, (2009); Angel A., Sarkas N., Koudas N., Srivastava D., Dense subgraph maintenance under streaming edge weight updates for real-Time story identification, Proc.

Prerequisite for understanding the spreading dynamics in on-line social networks, it finds applications in product marketing, promotions of innovative ideas, constraining negative information etc. The proposed prediction method IPRI (Influence scoring using Position, Reachability and Interaction) leverages prevailing hierarchy, interaction patterns and community structure in the network for identifying influential actors. The proposal is based on the hypothesis that capacity to influence other social actors is an interplay of three facets of an actor viz. (i) position in social hierarchy (ii) reach to diverse homophilic groups in network, and (iii) intensity of interactions with neighbours. Preliminary comparative performance evaluation of IPRI method against classical and state-of-the-art methods finds it effective. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Community; Hierarchy; Interaction; k-truss; Topology","Computer networks; Data mining; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Topology; Community; Community structures; Comparative performance; Hierarchy; Interaction; Negative information; On-line social networks; State-of-the-art methods; Big data","Al-Garadi M.A., Varathan K.D., Ravana S.D., Identification of influential spreaders in online social networks using interaction weighted k-core decomposition method, Phys.

As a new notion of cohesive subgraphs, truss has recently attracted a lot of research attentions in the database and data mining fields. At the same time, uncertainty is an intrinsic property of massive graph data, and truss decomposition (i.e., finding all k-trusses of a graph) has become a key primitive on uncertain graphs. In this paper, we study the truss decomposition problem on uncertain graphs, that is, finding all highly probable k-trusses of an uncertain graph. We first give an formal statement of the truss decomposition problem on uncertain graphs. Then, we prove that the truss decomposition of an uncertain graph attains two elegant properties, namely uniqueness and hierarchy. We show that the truss decomposition of an uncertain graph can be found in O(m1.5Q) time by proposing an in-memory algorithm called TDmem, where m is the number of edges of the uncertain graph, and Q is at most the maximum number of common neighbors of the endpoints of an edge. When an uncertain graph is too large to fit into main memory, we propose an external-memory algorithm TDI         /         O to find the truss decomposition of the uncertain graph. Extensive experiments have been carried out to evaluate the practical performance of the proposed algorithms. The experimental results verify that both TDmem and TDI         /         O are efficient when an uncertain graph is small enough to fit into main memory, and that TDI         /         O is much faster than TDmem when the graph is too large to fit into main memory. © 2016, Springer-Verlag London.","Cohesive subgraph; Truss; Truss decomposition; Truss number; Uncertain graph","Data mining; Graphic methods; Trusses; Database and data mining; Decomposition problems; External memory algorithms; Induced subgraphs; Intrinsic property; Memory algorithms; Subgraphs; Uncertain graphs; Graph algorithms","Boldi P., Bonchi F., Gionis A., Tassa T., Injecting uncertainty in graphs for identity obfuscation, Proc VLDB Endow (PVLDB), 5, 11, pp. 1376-1387, (2012); Bonchi F., Gullo F., Kaltenbrunner A., Vokovich Y., Core decomposition of uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD’14), (2014); Chakrabarti D., Zhan Y., Faloutsos C., R-MAT: A recursive model for graph mining, In: Proceedings of the 4th SIAM international conference on data mining (SDM’04), (2004); Cheng Y., Yuan Y., Wang G., Qiao B., Wang Z., Efficient sampling methods for shortest path query over uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the 19th international conference on database systems for advanced applications (DASFAA’14), (2014); Chu S., Cheng J., Triangle listing in massive networks, ACM Trans Knowl Discov Data (TKDD), 6, 4, (2012); Cohen J., Trusses: cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, Technical Report, (2008); Cohen J., Graph twiddling in a mapreduce world, Comput Sci Eng, 11, 4, pp. 29-41, (2009); Querying k -truss community in large and dynamic graphs, In: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data (SIGMOD’14), (2014); Jin R., Liu L., Aggarwal C.C., Discovering highly reliable subgraphs in uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the 17th ACM SIGKDD international conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD’11), (2011); Jin R., Liu L., Ding B., Wang H., Distance-constraint reachability computation in uncertain graphs, Proc VLDB Endow (PVLDB), 4, 9, pp. 551-562, (2011); Khan A., Bonchi F., Gionis A., Gullo F., Fast reliability search in uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the 17th international conference on extending database technology (EDBT’14), (2014); Kollios G., Potamias M., Terzi E., Clustering large probabilistic graphs, IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng (TKDE), 25, 2, pp. 325-336, (2013); Kong X., Ragin A.B., Wang X., Yu P.S., Discriminative feature selection for uncertain graph classification, In: Proceedings of the 13th SIAM international conference on data mining (SDM’13), (2013); Stanford large network dataset collection, (2013); Li J., Zou Z., Gao H., Mining frequent subgraphs over uncertain graph databases under probabilistic semantics, VLDB J, 21, 6, pp. 753-777, (2012); Li R., Yu J.X., Mao R., Jin T., Efficient and accurate query evaluation on uncertain graphs via recursive stratified sampling, In: Proceedings of the 30th IEEE international conference on data engineering (ICDE’14), (2014); Lian X., Chen L., Efficient query answering in probabilistic RDF graphs, In: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on management of data (SIGMOD’11), (2011); Liu L., Jin R., Aggarwal C.C., Shen Y., Reliable clustering on uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the 12th IEEE international conference on data mining (ICDM’12), (2012); Papapetrou O., Ioannou E., Skoutas D., Efficient discovery of frequent subgraph patterns in uncertain graph databases, In: Proceedings of the 14th international conference on extending database technology (EDBT’11), (2011); Parchas P., Gullo F., Papadias D., Bonchi F., The pursuit of a good possible world: extracting representative instances of uncertain graphs, In: Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on managementof data (SIGMOD’14), (2014); Potamias M., Bonchi F., Gionis A., Kollios G., k-nearest neighbors in uncertain graphs, Proc VLDB Endow (PVLDB), 3, 1, pp. 997-1008, (2010); Schank T., Algorithmic aspects of trianlge-based network analysis.

Even the problems of computing most dense subgraphs (e.g., clique, quasi-clique, k-densest subgraph) are NP-hard, there exists polynomial time algorithms for computing k-core and k-truss. In this paper, we propose a novel dense subgraph, (formula presented), that leverages on a new type of important edges based on the concepts of k-core and k-truss. Compared with k-core and k-truss, (formula presented) can significantly discover the interesting and important structural information outside the scope of the k-core and k-truss. We study two useful problems of (formula presented) decomposition and (formula presented) search. In particular, we develop a (formula presented) decomposition algorithm to find all (formula presented) in a graph G by iteratively removing edges with the smallest (formula presented).

However, with the emergence of large online social networks, the running time of the traditional batch algorithms for k-truss decomposition is usually prohibitively long on such a graph with billions of edges and millions of vertices. Moreover, the size of a graph becomes too large to load into the main memory of a single machine. Currently, cloud computing has become an imperative way to process the big data. Thus, our aim is to design a scalable algorithm of k-truss decomposition in the scenario of cloud computing. In this paper, we first improve the existing distributed k-truss decomposition in the MapReduce framework. We then propose a theoretical basis for k-truss and use it to design an algorithm based on graph-parallel abstractions. Our experiment results show that our method in the graph-parallel abstraction significantly outperforms the methods based on MapReduce in terms of running time and disk usage. © 2014 IEEE.","k-truss decomposition; Large graph processing; Parallel processing","Abstracting; Algorithms; Cloud computing; Social networking (online); Trusses; Batch algorithms; Large graphs; Mapreduce frameworks; On-line social networks; Parallel processing; Running time; Scalable algorithms; Single- machines; Big data","Kempe D., Kleinberg J., Tardos E., Maximizing the spread of influence through a social network, KDD, pp. 137-146, (2003); He X., Song G., Chen W., Jiang Q., Influence blocking maximization in social networks under the competitive linear threshold model, SDM, pp. 463-474, (2012); Yang D.-N., Shen C.-Y., Lee W.-C., Chen M.-S., On socio-spatial group query for location-based social networks, SIGKDD, (2012); Yang D.-N., Chen Y.-L., Lee W.-C., Chen M.-S., On socialtemporal group query with acquaintance constraint, VLDB, (2011); Yu H., Paccanaro A., Trifonov V., Gerstein M., Predicting interactions in protein networks by completing defective cliques, Bioinformatics, 22, pp. 823-829, (2006); Cohen J.D., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, (2008); Wang J., Cheng J., Truss decomposition in massive networks, VLDB, (2012); Cohen J., Graph twiddling in a mapreduce world, Computing in Science &Engineering, 11, 4, pp. 29-41, (2009); Dean J., Ghemawat S., Mapreduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, OSDI, (2004); Malewicz G., Austern M.H., Bik A.J., Dehnert J.C., Horn I., Leiser N., Czajkowski G., Pregel: A system for large-scale graph processing, SIGMOD, (2010); Valiant L.G., A bridging model for parallel computation, Communications of the ACM, 33, 8, pp. 103-111, (1990); Seo S., Yoon E.J., Kim J., Jin S., Kim J.-S., Maeng S., Hama: An efficient matrix computation with the mapreduce framework, CloudCom, (2010); Low Y., Bickson D., Gonzalez J., Guestrin C., Kyrola A., Hellerstein J.M., Distributed graphlab: A framework for machine learning and data mining in the cloud, VLDB, (2012); Gonzalez J.E., Low Y., Gu H., Bickson D., Guestrin C., Powergraph: Distributed graph-parallel computation on natural graphs, OSDI, (2012); Cheng J., Zhu L., Ke Y., Chu S., Fast algorithms for maximal clique enumeration with limited memory, SIGKDD, (2012); Fan W., Wang X., Wu Y., Performance guarantees for distributed reachability queries, VLDB, (2012); Chu S., Cheng J., Triangle listing in massive networks and its applications, SIGKDD, (2011); Li R.-H., Yu J.X., Mao R., Efficient core maintenance in large dynamic graphs, TKDE, 26, 10, pp. 2453-2465, (2014); Montresor A., De Pellegrini F., Miorandi D., Distributed k-core decomposition, TPDS, 24, 2, pp. 288-300, (2013); Cheng J., Ke Y., Chu S., Ozsu M.T., Efficient core decomposition in massive networks, ICDE, (2011); Sariyuce A.E., Gedik B., Jacques-Silva G., Wu K.-L., Catalyurek U.V., Streaming algorithms for k-core decomposition, VLDB, (2013); Leskovec J., Faloutsos C., Scalable modeling of real graphs using kronecker multiplication, ICML, (2007)","","Chang W.; Huan J.; Cercone N.; Pyne S.; Honavar V.; Lin J.; Hu X.T.; Aggarwal C.; Mobasher B.; Pei J.; Nambiar R.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","978-147995665-4","","","English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

While the problem of computing most co-hesive subgraphs is NP-hard, there exists a polynomial time al-gorithm for computing k-truss. Compared with k-core which is also efficient to compute, k-truss represents the "" core"" of a k-core that keeps the key information of, while filtering out less impor-tant information from, the k-core. However, existing algorithms for computing k-truss are inefficient for handling today's massive networks. We first improve the existing in-memory algorithm for computing k-truss in networks of moderate size. Then, we propose two I/O-efficient algorithms to handle massive networks that can-not fit in main memory.

In most real life networks a query node normally involves in several communities, therefore, most likely the same query results into communities of different densities. In this paper, based on the concept of k-Truss, which is a type of cohesive subgraph, we propose linear-Time algorithms to find the top-r k-Truss communities containing a query node in large graphs. We adapt some optimal index construction strategies which can support efficient search of top-r k-Truss communities with a linear cost to work for top-r community search. We carry out extensive experiments on real-world large networks, and the results signify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2017 IEEE.","Algorithm; Community search; K-Truss; Large graph","Algorithms; Clustering algorithms; Information services; Trusses; Community search; Connected subgraphs; Different densities; Index construction; Information networks; Large graphs; Linear-time algorithms; Real-life networks; Big data","Huang X., Cheng H., Qin L., Tian W., Yu J.X., Querying k-Truss community in large and dynamic graphs, ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2014); Huang X., Lakshmanan L.V.S., Yu J.X., Cheng H., Approximate closest community search in networks, VLDB Endowment, 9, 4, pp. 276-287, (2015); Cohen J., Trusses: Cohesive subgraphs for social network analysis, National Security Agency Technical Report, (2008); Li R.H., Qin L., Yu J.X., Mao R., Influential community searches in large networks, VLDB Endowment, 8, 5, pp. 509-520, (2015); Sozia M., Gionis A., The community-search problem and how to plan a successful cocktail party, ACM The 16th ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, (2010); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Wang W., Local search of communities in large graphs, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2014); Cui W., Xiao Y., Wang H., Lu Y., Wang W., Online search of overlapping communities, Proceedings of the 2013 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, (2013); Shan J., Shen D., Nie T., Kou Y., Yue G., An efficient approach of overlapping communities search, International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications, (2015); Shan J., Shen D., Nie T., Kou Y., Yue G., Searching overlapping communities for group query, World Wide Web, pp. 1-24, (2015); Palla G., Derenyi I., Farkas I., Vicsek T., Uncovering the overlapping community structure of complex networks in nature and society, Nature, 435, 7043, pp. 814-818, (2005); Adamcsek B., Palla G., Farkas I.J., Derenyi I., Vicsek T., Cfinder: Locating cliques and overlapping modules in biological networks, Bioinformatics, 22, 8, pp. 1021-1023, (2006); Bagrow J.P., Bollt E.M., Local method for detecting communities, Phys.

As an online, query-dependent variant of the well-known community detection problem, community search enables personalized community discovery that has found widely varying applications in real-world, largescale graphs. In this paper, we study the community search problem in the truss-based model aimed at discovering all dense and cohesive k-truss communities to which the query vertex q belongs. We introduce a novel equivalence relation, k-truss equivalence, to model the intrinsic density and cohesiveness of edges in k-truss communities. Consequently, all the edges of G can be partitioned to a series of k-truss equivalence classes that constitute a space-efficient, trusspreserving index structure, EquiTruss. Community search can be henceforth addressed directly upon EquiTruss without repeated, time-demanding accesses to the original graph, G, which proves to be theoretically optimal. In addition, EquiTruss can be efficiently updated in a dynamic fashion when G evolves with edge insertion and deletion. Experimental studies in real-world, large-scale graphs validate the efficiency and effectiveness of EquiTruss, which has achieved at least an order of magnitude speedup in community search over the state-of-the-art method, TCP-Index. © 2017 VLDB.","","Equivalence classes; Trusses; Community detection; Community discoveries; Connected subgraphs; Equivalence relations; Indexing approaches; Intrinsic density; State-of-the-art methods; Truss-based model; Graph theory","Barbieri N., Bonchi F., Galimberti E., Gullo F., Efficient and Effective Community Search, Data Min.

In this paper, we study online community search which is practically useful but less studied in the literature. Given a query vertex in a graph, the problem is to find meaningful communities that the vertex belongs to in an online manner. We propose a novel community model based on the κ-truss concept, which brings nice structural and computational properties. We design a compact and elegant index structure which supports the efficient search of κ-truss communities with a linear cost with respect to the community size. In addition, we investigate the κ truss community search problem in a dynamic graph setting with frequent insertions and deletions of graph vertices and edges.

Yet most standard formulations of this problem (like clique, quasi-clique, densest at-least-k subgraph) are NP-hard. Furthermore, the goal is rarely to find the ""true optimum"" but to identify many (if not all) dense substructures, understand their distribution in the graph, and ideally determine relationships among them. Current dense subgraph finding algorithms usually optimize some objective and only find a few such subgraphs without providing any structural relations. We define the nucleus decomposition of a graph, which represents the graph as a forest of nuclei. Each nucleus is a subgraph where smaller cliques are present in many larger cliques. The forest of nuclei is a hierarchy by containment, where the edge density increases as we proceed towards leaf nuclei. Sibling nuclei can have limited intersections, which enables discovering overlapping dense subgraphs. With the right parameters, the nucleus decomposition generalizes the classic notions of k-core and k-truss decompositions. We present practical algorithms for nucleus decompositions and empirically evaluate their behavior in a variety of real graphs. The tree of nuclei consistently gives a global, hierarchical snapshot of dense substructures and outputs dense subgraphs of comparable quality with the state-of-the-art solutions that are dense and have non-trivial sizes. Our algorithms can process real-world graphs with tens of millions of edges in less than an hour. We demonstrate how proposed algorithms can be utilized on a citation network. Our analysis showed that dense units identified by our algorithms correspond to coherent articles on a specific area. Our experiments also show that we can identify dense structures that are lost within larger structures by other methods and find further finer grain structure within dense groups. © 2017 ACM.","Dense subgraph discovery; Density hierarchy; Graph decomposition; K-core; K-truss; Overlapping dense subgraphs","Forestry; Trusses; Citation networks; Dense structures; Dense sub-graphs; Dense subgraph; Finding algorithm; Graph decompositions; K-cores; Real-world graphs; Optimization","Adcock A.B., Sullivan B.D., Mahoney M.W., Tree-like structure in large social and information networks, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM), pp. 1-10, (2013); Ignacio Alvarez-Hamelin J., Barrat A., Vespignani A., Large scale networks fingerprinting and visualization using the k-core decomposition, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 18, pp. 41-50, (2006); Andersen R., Chellapilla K., Finding dense subgraphs with size bounds, Proceedings of the Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web-graph (WAW), pp. 25-37, (2009); Angel A., Sarkas N., Koudas N., Srivastava D., Dense subgraph maintenance under streaming edge weight updates for real-time story identification, Proc.
