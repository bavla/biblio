Bibliographic networks consider different types of relations between publications and their authors, 
thus underlying different patterns of collaboration in science (co-authorship, co-citation, citing). 
Data for such networks can be quite easily obtained from special bibliographies (BibTEX) and 
bibliographic services (Web of Science, Scopus, SICRIS, CiteSeer, Zentralblatt MATH, Google Scholar, 
DBLP Bibliography, US patent office, IMDb, and others). Besides names of authors and titles of their
works, more detailed information about them can be obtained: institution, country, time of the first
work, time of the last work – for authors; publisher, journal, editor/s, number, volume, pages, 
key words, time of submission, language, classification/s – for works. With different procedures 
of networks transformation we can get many different kinds of mostly two-mode networks and study 
relations between different entities included in data bases (works, authors, journals, key words, 
institutions, countries, etc.).

## Outline

### 1. Transforming bibliographic data into networks



Typical data
- (semi) structured from data bases
- data from bibliographies

Problem 1: detail of description (list of attributes); completnes of description (all authors?)

Problem 2: different cultures in different disciplines
- examples of diverse citation practices

Problem 3: entity identification/resolution
- synonyms, homonyms
  - normalization - at data entry
  - standardization use standards whenever possible
    - ORCID
    - DOI
    - ISBN
    -standard abreviations
  - "dictionaries"

Boundary problem when extracting subset of data
