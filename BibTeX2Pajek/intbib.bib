%%%                        First of all, the author is deeply indebted
%%%                        to Irv Lustig, Princeton. His salient

%%%                        of this bibliography.
%%%
%%%                        Based on Lustig's idea ``to indicate that
%%%                        something is a talk'' (because, sometimes, a
%%%                        talk and the corresponding report differs
%%%                        only in title) the author has rewritten his
%%%                        Discussion Paper published at the
%%%                        FernUniversit{\"a}t Hagen, May 1991. A list
%%%                        of crossreferences between talks and reports
%%%                        will be soon published, I hope.
%%%
%%%                        Many thanks to Dick den Hertog, PhD-student
%%%                        at the TU Delft (The Netherlands), for

%%%                        incorporated into this bibliography.
%%%
%%%                        At last, the author is obliged to Eric
%%%                        Grosse and Dave Gay for making this
